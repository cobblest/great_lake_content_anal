25	Mobile Baykeeper has gotten several calls about a robo call that went out yesterday regarding the oil pipeline and tar sands issues in Mobile and the Mobile mayor's race.  As you know, Mobile Baykeeper does not endorse candidates.  Our job is to research and educate, so we want to make sure folks know where both candidates stand on the pipeline and tar sands.Below is a statement from Sandy Stimpson: On tar sands: "My primary concern as a citizen of Mobile is with the health and safety of its citizens and environment. As mayor, that won't change. I will never allow anything to endanger the integrity of Mobile's environment. Everything I have learned about tar sands has led me to believe it is not somethingthat should be allowed into our city. I stand by that. We have already been victims of the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Why would we want to put ourselves at great risk once again?" -Sandy StimpsonOn the Plains pipeline, Sandy has been against it running through the big creek watershed and posted a petition immediately after learning of the project. In addition "As mayor, I will ensure the citizens are informed and have an opportunity to join in the conversation anytime a project of this nature is proposed and (most importantly) before it is approved and under construction. And I will engage the watchdog groups, such as Mobile Baykeeper, to help me protect our drinking water and our environment." -Sandy StimpsonMayor Sam Jones has also led efforts to oppose the pipeline crossing our drinking water supply and has stated that there should be no tar sands in Mobile.  Both of these candidates share the same stance on tar sands and the pipeline.  We do not have a position statement from mayoral candidate Dr. Brown.		Mobile Baykeeper	21:24:33	08-23	2013	19	17	2	0	0

109	Hey folks, I need a favor from my Gulf Coast, extended family. When the hands across the sand event happens on the 18th, I would like to get you and a few friends to make a couple of signs to say, "we support no deep sea drilling in New Zealand." Get as many photos as possible, send them to me. You don't have to hold them up long but it would really help bolster the effort I am mounting here to stop in before it starts. We have a tremendous ground swell of support and I honestly believe there is a chance to stop it. I will be forever in your debt. Thanks		John Wathen	13:16:25	05-11	2013	0	1	0	0	0
