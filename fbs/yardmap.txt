1	Great Crested Flycatcher Food <3'sOne of the most frequent questions we get here at YardMap is about which birds like which plants. Turns out there is some science to support this. We sifted through it and created these beautiful species portraits to clue you into the favorites of several bird species.A treetop hunter of deciduous forests and suburban areas, the Great Crested Flycatcher is easier to hear than to see. The only eastern flycatcher that nests in cavities, it often includes snakeskin in the nest lining (how's that for specialized?). Besides its favorite food, flying insects, these birds are also known to eat wild grapes, mulberries, sassafras fruit and cherries. Keep your ears peeled for this sharp neotropical migrant in your neighborhood.See more profiles at: http://content.yardmap.org/learn/which-birds-which-plants/ or follow us here to see them posted occasionally.		12:00:00	08-26	2013	2	26	2	1	1

3	People in Southwestern desert cities have been complaining about the decrease in Cactus Wrens in their neighborhoods.  Declining populations of these personable, insect-loving desert dwellers are well-documented. Their fall is happening alongside record growth in human populations in these areas. Cactus Wrens have very particular nesting requirements. They prefer 'spinescent vegetation,' mostly cholla and prickly pear (although there have been documented nests in giant saguaro, palo verde, catclaw acacia, and clumps of desert mistletoe). They also only build if the plant is at least 3 feet high. Cactus take several years to reach this height and must be valued as the important habitat features they are when they do.The good news? Southwesterners can use their yards to help extend habitat...especially out near the edges of the city. Prioritizing native desert landscaping with lots of mature thorny cacti, insects, and  long-stemmed grasses can provide much needed territory for these spunky birds.YardMap just added new cactus icons to our suite of mapping objects. Share this with your southwestern friends, and encourage them to get on board with yardmap to help out this unique bird.

5	How many kinds of birds flock through your yard?The most reported species seen in a single yard is 266! That is a HUGE number, and a bit out of range for most of us, but keeping a "yard list" is a fun and easy way to watch your bird-friendly stewardship pay off. Just start a list of every bird species that you have seen from your own yard (how you define that is up to you), and pretty soon you'll be looking for ways to make your yard better-than-average for birds. While many properties can and do support hundreds of different bird species, the average American urban yard can easily attract at least 50 kinds of beautiful, interesting birds with the right planning! Start building habitat, and let the birds come to you.Map that habitat with www.YardMap.org and keep track of that yard list with eBird.org with one username and account.ReferencesCornell Lab of Ornithology.

We sifted through it and created these beautiful species portraits to clue you into the favorites of several bird species.The tree swallow is an iridescent acrobat found across N. America. While this bird is famous for its primary food source, flying insects, it also eats Juniper cones (which are very berry-like), and the fruits from bayberry, wax-myrtle, and other Myrica species.See more profiles at http://content.yardmap.org/learn/which-birds-which-plants/ or follow us here to see them posted occasionally.		12:00:01	08-19	2013	2	31	2	1	1
8	Goldenrod is an extremely common plant in North America. It has a long history of being considered a weed here, but in Europe people prize it as a garden ornamental (it is also an invasive there). Funny how we always seem to want something exotic....Ecologically, goldenrods are important wildlife plants; birds perform acrobatics to get at the seedheads late in Summer and Fall, and many goldenrod plants develop the characteristic swollen globe on their stem this time of year called a 'gall.' This structure contains a larva of an insect (there are many different kinds). Birds love to drill into these galls in the Fall and Winter to find themselves a rare morsel of protein!Consider leaving goldenrods standing through the Winter around your property, you might be rewarded with some fantastic bird antics as they visit these glorious plants for the tasty treats they provide.		12:00:00	08-16	2013	17	47	2	1	1

16	If you've noticed more feathers around your yard, it might be because it is molting season for many birds. Feathers wear out and must be replaced, but the process puts birds in a vulnerable position, making them less mobile. August is the perfect month to molt because it is a quiet time between nesting and migration. You can use your yard to provide safe places for birds to molt by making sure there are spots with dense vegetative cover for them to hide in. Thorny plants are a favorite. Sometimes you'll find feathers for other reasons, like predation. Feathers from molting are usually individual feathers, while feathers from an attack are piled or clumped together.Also, remember the Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the collection of feathers. Your best approach is to be hands off...look but don't collect.Learn more about molting: http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/studying/feathers/molting		16:54:45	08-09	2013	2	18	0	1	1

But do you know your ecoregion?Your ecoregion is the unique combination of living and nonliving factors that set your landscape apart and determine what will flourish there.

19	We often spend part of our Sunday in our yard doing chores, picking produce, and maintaining our plants. One of those chores is often removing excessive hornworms from our tomatoes. Caterpillar poop might be good for plants, but more than one hornworm seems like more than "mild" herbivory. The trouble? Those hornworms are difficult to spot! That is, until we learned this one neat trick . . . Hornworms glow green under black light, while the tomato plant shows as a dull red. This makes the caterpillars stick out like neon sign on a dark desert road. Now, we save that chore for night, and it is less like a chore and more like a safari. So, defend your yard without chemicals this August!		14:40:35	08-04	2013	1	20	2	1	1
20	Plants can compensate for mild herbivory (being munched on by caterpillars and the like) by growing more vigorously. This is why, after you mow your grass, it only seems to grow back stronger (but mow it every single day, and it will die).However, if you spray pesticides to remove all insect herbivores, the net effect is a negative one. Not only are you removing an important food source for birds, but the lack of caterpillar poop (which would otherwise be fertilizer deposited right at the base of the plant) is worse for the plant than the effects of mild herbivory (which it has adapted to).And that, friends, is why we should not freak out over a handful of caterpillars on our tomato plants. Ecology and evolutionary biology have our backs.		12:30:00	08-02	2013	45	36	2	1	1

24	Everyone knows what a snag is, whether or not they know it by that name. A snag is simply a standing dead or partially-dead tree. While some people may view them as hazardous or untidy, snags are actually quite important to wildlife. Many animals make their homes in or on snags, including birds, bats, small mammals, snakes, and invertebrates. Snags are extremely important structural elements in forested habitats, and may make up the entire habitat of some creatures, like insects. There are about 80 species of birds in North America that nest only in cavities, from the mighty chickadee to the marvelous Wood Duck. Many species of birds, spanning a staggering array of families (flycatchers, titmice, nuthatches, raptors, bluebirds, and so many more!) just cannot reproduce without these cavities.So spread the word to friends and neighbors - dead trees are wildlife gifts - save them if they aren't threats to your home or property.Learn More: http://content.yardmap.org/learn/habitat-types/snags/		11:00:01	07-26	2013	94	60	2	1	1

26	If left alone lawns turn brown in the hot summer months. Many people think of these lawns as dead or unkempt, but it is a completely normal phase in a lawn's life cycle that you can take advantage of to help reduce your water use during dry months.Dormancy is simply a state of reduced water usage where the plant focuses resources on the roots. Lawns can stay dormant with no water for up to a month. In most places, that is long enough for a summer rain to fall and keep the lawn alive without you having to get out the sprinkler. In places without rain for longer periods of time, it might be best to move on to more drought-friendly landscaping. Embrace the Brown. Be Proud. Share so your parents, kids, and friends know Brown is Normal when it comes to summertime lawns.		19:16:07	07-22	2013	29	18	2	1	1

32	Birds + 4th of July probably conjures images of majestic bald eagles, but we hope you'll pause, fireworks in hand this 4th, and think about all the song birds in your neighborhood. Dogs are famous for getting freaked out on the Fourth, but that effect doesn't stop with our canine friends - birds and other wildlife feel the impacts of our celebrations as well. Remember back when all of those red-winged black birds died in arkansas? Yeah, that was fireworks. Lucky for us, that kind of effect is really rare, especially in summer (those birds were all grouped together in a relatively small space because it was winter, and that is what they do). Still, consider skipping the fireworks at home, and just head out to your community show.There is even a research team in amsterdam using radar to study the effects of fireworks on birds: http://bit.ly/Tsfqe0		19:18:55	07-02	2013	1	9	0	1	1

42	Considerable evidence suggests that exposure to “green” environments can enhance human effectiveness and make life’s demands seem manageable. Children living in buildings without nearby trees and grass reported more procrastination in facing their major issues and assessed their issues as more severe, less soluble, and more longstanding than did their counterparts living in greener surroundings. Mediation tests and extensive tests for possible confounds supported the attention restoration hypothesis— that green space enhances children's’ effectiveness by reducing mental fatigue.Involving kids in citizen science is one way to get more nature into their lives.

132	Planting a butterfly garden is a great way to help wildlife!  Here are 5 tips to bring in more butterflies this year:1. Plant in the sun because butterflies seek out warmth.2. Create dense groupings of a single nectar-producing plant (preferably with red, orange, or pink blooms); it makes them easier for butterflies to find.3. Don't use pesticides or insecticides.4. Use the least- hybridized variety of plant you can. The closer it is to native, the higher the nectar quality.5. Set out stones in sunny spots for butterflies to bask on.		19:35:25	02-01	2013	3	21	2	0	0
133	In New Zealand, where birds have evolved in the absence of feline predators, one man proposes a radical solution to save vanishing birds: all cats must go. Around 40% of New Zealand’s native land-birds are already extinct, and of the ones remaining 37% are endangered. Given that Kiwis have the highest number of cats per capita, will this idea really ever get off the ground?		14:47:21	01-31	2013	1	2	2	1	1

139	This time of year, you might be wondering, "What is mistletoe anyway?" Mistletoe species are found throughout the United States, being primarily spread by birds. The fruit-eating Phainopepla is especially associated with mistletoe in the West. Mistletoes are parasitic on their host plants, although they do some photosynthesis. All parts of the plant are toxic to people and pets.		16:23:33	12-14	2012	0	3	2	1	1

164	When it comes to fruit, beauty is sometimes only skin deep. This berry–which may be the fairest of them all–deploys its good looks to entice birds to disperse its seeds. However, the trickery lies in the fact that it has no nutritional value for birds. The take-home lesson: don't be fooled by plant beauty; favor shrubs whose fruits provide valuable fats and nutrients for birds!		18:03:36	09-11	2012	0	2	2	1	1

198	Interesting to see the pie chart after mapping.  I think it would be good to have a target amount of square feet of habitat types for yards in each ecoregion to set as a goal.  Obviously lawn is bad, but would clearing trees for grass where that habitat is lacking bad as well?  		19:19:05	06-19	2012	0	0	2	0	0
