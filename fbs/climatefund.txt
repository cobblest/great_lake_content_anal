24	Full Moon Candlelight Vigil and Welcome HomeHello, All.I know this is rather late notice but I think it's extremely important. We encourage all groups that are invested in this fight to share this, and help us show our appreciation to Sandra Steingraber, Melissa Chipman and Michael Dineen. So, we are inviting you to join us Wednesday, April 24th at 11:30 pm, in front of the Schuyler County Jail at 106 10th St in Watkins Glen, NY for a Candlelight Vigil. Sandra and Melissa of the "Seneca Lake 3" will be released from jail at that location at 12:01 am. What better way to show our love and support for these 2 heroes than to be there, and give somber applause as they make their exhausted way from confinement to freedom. We will re-convene at the same location at 8:30 am when Michael Dineen will be released.We have had tremendous attendance at the nightly Vigils throughout this period. Please, and I know this is asking a lot, be there one last time for the 3 who made the decision to spend some of their life currency defending the jewel that is Seneca Lake!!  -- Joseph M Campbell, DCPresident and Co-FounderGas Free Senecawww.gasfreeseneca.com		Gas Free Seneca	01:45:51	04-24	2013	0	0	0	1	1

28	It's amazing how complex the systems are.  The Antarctic sea ice is melting from below in a warming ocean.  This has trapped the usually sinking saltier water when the ocean freezes over in a lens above this fresher water from melting icebergs.  The result? the thermohaline (temperature/salt) gradient is degraded which runs the conveyor belt of ocean currents up to Atlantic Ocean.  What happens next?

137	Another thing about climate change is how complex and chaotic it is likely to be. Take for example, Bill McKibben’s recent article in Rolling Stone about the surprise we got this summer when the entire Greenland ice sheet was melting all at once (far earlier than predicted). http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-arctic-ice-crisis-20120816The part that most alarmed me was this statement: “Simply by changing the albedo of the Greenland ice sheet, Box calculates, the island now absorbs more extra energy each summer than the U.S. consumes in a year.”This is a sobering statement. Because we’ve got a surface melt going in Greenland thanks to our consumption of fossil fuel, we’ve created a positive feedback loop of staggering proportions. It’s hard to contemplate.But, we also know that as the Greenland glaciers melt, the water will run into the Atlantic Ocean and will short circuit the flow of the warm Gulf Stream as it comes up our eastern coast and circulates over to Great Britain and Europe’s coasts. This will likely create a significant cooling effect, especially for Britain.My question to Ben is whether climate scientists are making any progress at predicting how these two feedback loops will interact? As the albedo dims up north and the Earth warms even faster, how will the warming interact with the cooling of a broken Gulf Stream for the Northeastern part of North America?

156	You might want to join us on this one..."On Thursday, August 2 at 3 pm Eastern / 2pm Central / 1pm Mountain / 12 noon Pacific time, the Climate Reality Check coalition will hold the latest in our series of national conference calls to help strengthen community organizing on climate, entitled: Exporting Climate Change: Strategies for fighting coal and natural gas exports.As Bill McKibben’s recent Rolling Stone piece made frighteningly clear, we have access to much more carbon than the atmosphere can absorb. Within the last five years, new technologies have enabled much greater access to fossil fuels. Cheap gas is replacing coal, so coal is looking for new markets. Gas is so abundant that despite increasing its share of power generation, it still needs bigger markets to generate the profits the industry seeks. While gasoline and diesel are in decline due to greater efficiency, Latin American markets for them are booming.  And, the oil boom may produce more light sweet oil than America’s refineries can use (because so much capacity is now configured for Canada’s extra heavy tar sands oil) leading to talk of exports there. These facts have led to plans for more export terminals, pipelines, coal trains etc. and organizers are looking at new strategies to intervene.Join us as we discuss the economic, political and climate ramifications of the US exporting climate change and strategies to stop the boom.We are pleased to have Deborah J. Nardone, Director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Natural Gas Campaign, Bethany Cotton of Greenpeace, and Lorne Stockman, working with Oil Change International, lead the discussion.Please RSVP here:https://spreadsheets2.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFNyS3N0aEMzSnktR0c0UEkwY0NfQ0E6MQThe call-in number is 209-647-1600 Code 615986."
