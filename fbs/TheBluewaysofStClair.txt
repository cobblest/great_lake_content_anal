57	Friends of Weekend Warrior Lawn & Maintenance,Just around midnight this morning/night depending on how you look at it, we were driving past the Arbor's of Saint Clair in Port Huron on a nice family cruise. Our baby son was in the backseat of the car, and things were going good.Suddenly, there was a loud "POP" sound, and the next thing we knew, our rear windshield was spider-webbed and sagging! Somebody SHOT our windshield out last night from within the Arbors of Saint Clair!FORTUNATELY OUR BABY WAS NOT HARMED IN ANY WAY from this. However, our windshield has been rendered completely useless. Shortly after it collapsed inwards on the way home. By now we had moved our baby into his grandmothers car so he would be safe.This put quite the damper on our night, as you can imagine. Our situation has now become your gain. We are offering specials right now out of necessity. If you or somebody you know is looking for complete yard work: lawn mowing, precision edging of the sidewalk, landscaped areas & curb, followed with clean up, please call us today at (810) 309 - 1230This is an unprecedented time to take advantage of one-time only, non-contracted yard work from an experienced crew. The more calls we get, the more our friends get to save. So call us right now, and send our story and information to all of your friends and family!The police said they have received calls about this happening a lot from there lately, we ask that you call the Arbors of Saint Clair offices and let them know how you feel about their tenants behaving this way.  Arbors of Saint Clair: (810) 984 - 4041Please tell everyone you know about this. We look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you for your support, and we hope your holiday is safe and fun.-Chris & Rachelle, Weekend Warrior Lawn & Maintenance(810) 309 - 1230		Weekend Warrior Lawn & Maintenance	07:49:22	07-01	2012	0	0	0	0	0
