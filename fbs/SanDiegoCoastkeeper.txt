106	When I was a young guy working at the Jersey Shore, we had an old inefficient hot water heater. One day my roommate's father who had served in the Marine Corp said, "George, you guys should take a 'NAVY shower'". What's that? we asked. "Well you get wet, turn off the water, lather up, then turn the water back on to rinse."   So...can you imagine how many thousand gallons could be saved in just one day if San Diego adopted this NAVY shower practice?! We are a military community which is custom made for  a promotion of this water saving technique. Hint, hint. You Coastkeepers can do this!   Ed E lliot		20:04:41	05-22	2013	0	0	2	0	0

120	The beaches near the lagoon outlets at Torrey Pines State Park and Cardiff State Park have been closed as a precaution since tehy are dredging the openings of the lagoon. These openings help to maintain the coastal wetland's connection to the ocean, allowing for tidal circulation. The dredging may stir up some nastyness from the bottom though, so it's best to stay away from the beach for a bit. Check back on our beach status page, or your swim guide app on your smartphone to see when it's safe to swim again.http://www.sdcoastkeeper.org/learn/san-diegos-waters/coastal-water.html		17:00:48	05-13	2013	0	2	0	0	1

Then you put a bit of natural matter, mixed with septic starter and voila!

With respect and clever characterization, she makes fleas and other creepy-crawlies downright sympathetic." --Publisher's Weekly"Angus, an artist who creates (art) installations using bugs, excels with her insect characters...the final twist may surprise all."  --Kirkus Reviews“It is a grand adventure.”  --School Library JournalThe book is published by Albert Whitman in Chicago.https://www.albertwhitman.com/content.cfm/bookdetails/In-Search-of-Goliathus-Hercules  You can review Angus’ personal website to see her incredible artwork that inspired Goliathus Hercules.www.jenniferangus.com		00:23:40	03-21	2013	0	0	0	1	1
174	In case you needed more reminders about staying out of Imperial Beach Beaches, here is an email we just got from the International Boundary and Water Commission:"It appears that there was a spill to the Tijuana River yesterday around 3 pm, according to the flow increase on the gage record at that time.  Based upon visual quality of the flow checked in the past hour, it appears to be sewage, which is continuing but abating.  We requested Mexico to resume operation of the CILA Pump Station, which has been off since Mar 8."Combined with ocean currents flowing north right now, it means that a lot of sewage is flowing around those beaches.
