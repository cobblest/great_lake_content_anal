12	FOR PLANNING PURPOSESTuesday, July 15, 2014 Contact:  Jessica Ferrato, 216-339-9855, Jessica.ferrato@sierraclub.org  Ohio Sierra Club recognizes that combined and sanitary sewer overflows in Northeast Ohio can contribute harmful impacts to the protection and everyday enjoyment of our favorite recreational waterways and natural habitats.  In order to do our part to help stem the tide of raw sewage, we’re asking our membership and any other interested parties to contribute to our basement flood survey.  By making sure that our city officials, regional sewer & environmental agencies, and watershed groups have the best information about our infrastructure’s vulnerabilities, we can combat the problem of sewer overflows more effectively and efficiently.  Anyone who has experienced a basement flood event in the last 5 years may follow the link below to our survey and /or share with others who have experienced flooding in their basements.  You can also find the survey through Ohio Sierra Club’s website at the second link listed below.   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kK-ghyh1VHSCgVcfp4tjiuFzh61sZYdSUo3h9ARdboY/viewform?c=0&w=1 http://ohiosierraclub.org/all-committees/conservation-committee/water-committee/conservation/help-protect-our-water-report-your-basement-floods-here/Please feel free to publish a link to our survey in your community’s newsletters or water bills.  As we gather enough survey responses to identify problem areas within our communities, Sierra Club may reach out to form partnerships with those communities that see the most challenges.  We would love to engage our volunteers to work within their communities on stormwater management and green infrastructure projects.  And as always, your feedback is extremely valuable, so if you have any suggestions regarding improvements to the survey or how best to utilize the data, please get in touch!

One of the training sites was Wood Creek (named Hemlock Creek by the Metroparks) in the Bedford Reservation. Wood Creek is a tributary to Tinker's Creek that runs through mostly urbanized areas and Bedford's waste water treatment plant (WWTP) empties into this creek. Wood Creek scored 68.5 indicating that the creek has good habitat quality.		Tinker's Creek Watershed Partners	15:26:19	05-22	2014	0	1	0	1	1

35	With these cold temperatures, did you know that more salt isn't always better? Here are some facts about road salt (excess salt can pollute soil and water). For more information watch the video below.•	15°F is too cold for salt. Most salts stop working at this temperature. Use sand instead for traction, but remember that sand does not melt ice.•	Application. For best results, apply salt to cleared surfaces only and avoid overlapping of crystals. Consider purchasing a hand-held spreader to help you apply a consistent amount.•	More salt does not mean more melting. Use less than 4 pounds of salt per 1,000 square feet (an average parking space is about 150 square feet). One pound of salt is approximately a heaping 12-ounce coffee mug. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc8Y-_Nmfmo&feature=youtu.be		Tinker's Creek Watershed Partners	14:50:30	01-28	2014	1	3	0	1	1
