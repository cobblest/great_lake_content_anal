63	Anyone aware of any progress or negotiations on the Flat Rock Dam portage? I took this path on the river this weekend, unaware of the (seemingly illegal) obstruction on this otherwise navigable waterway. After trying to find a way around for some time I was met by another through paddler who was more prepared. He had called in advance to make arrangements, and called again several times upon arrival, but none of these calls were answered. Likewise, several employees of the metal plant were present and in clear view as we stood at the fence waving and shouting to get their attention, but all seed to turn a blind eye, quite obviously intentionally ignoring.This seems like a blatantly illegal obstruction, willfully and intentionally denying right to portage in spite of ample reasonable attempts to contact for arrangements. And don't get me started on the lack of any buoy line or signage at all above the dam. Seems like several lawsuits waiting to happen, both for the metal plant and the city.
