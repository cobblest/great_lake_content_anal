5	Riverkeeper is blowing the whistle again on the new Tappan Zee Bridge project – this time over illegal construction at an upriver staging area in Coeymans before necessary permits were obtained. It's more evidence of why we need a full environmental review of this staging area threatening sturgeon habitats and other sensitive areas."It’s undisputed that the Coeymans TZB Staging Area is inherently connected to the larger bridge construction project happening downriver, and must be held to the same level of environmental review and strict permit requirements as the bridge replacement itself,” Riverkeeper’s Phillip Musegaas says.

6	Oil spills and derailments pose a major threat to the Hudson and our communities –­ and it's an outrage that the state is withholding information we need to protect ourselves."First, the government and industry were ridiculously slow to respond when the media and environmental and government watchdog groups asked for rudimentary information, such as the number and frequency of shipments coming through the area. Now the state is taking way too long to release details of a key oil-spill drill that could shed valuable light on emergency response."Read the Poughkeepsie Journal editorial: http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/opinion/editorials/2014/09/06/editorial-spill-oil-mock/15209219/(Photo: Poughkeepsie Journal)		Riverkeeper	15:38:34	09-08	2014	13	25	2	1	1

34	To all Public Servants...and American Citizens, who are NOT FIREPROOF, or even fire resistant; stand your ground, and speak up for your family and community...On September 23, 2014, in Bismarck, North Dakota; three men will hear public testimony, then make a decision that will affect Public Safety for millions.Five times; Bakken oil trains have derailed and violently exploded, sending fireballs hundreds of feet into the air, killing dozens of people, and incinerating property. All because North Dakota regulators failed to require standard industry procedures.The crude oil from North Dakota could have been rendered NON-explosive, years ago.To remove the explosive element from Bakken crude, the trio MUST mandate the "stabilization" of the oil, with ACTUAL stabilizers, before shipping by rail. Nothing less. The explosions must stop.Stabilizers are pieces of equipment that remove the explosive "natural gas liquids" (NGL's), such as heptane, pentane, methane, propane, butane, ethane, isobutane, and, so on.The Commissioners, Lobbyists, and Industry will try to muddy the water with made-up language, diversionary off-topic comparisons, half measures, magical chemistry lessons, and kooky hearing rules.The North Dakota Industrial Commission has full and complete authority to fix this problem. They always have. Now, after 10 years...FINALLY, it needs to be done right.Furthermore; taxpayers are footing the bill for billions to outfit, equip, and train firefighters and emergency personnel to deal with a Bakken oil derailment and explosion. Quebec is on the hook for the $2.7 billion Lac-Megantic disaster...a village of 6,000. How much will it cost your community, if tragedy strikes? Will North Dakota pay?Stabilization is a cost of doing business, and the invoice is past due.The pressure must be equal to, or greater than, the pressure the oil industry already places on the malleable oil regulators in North Dakota.Your voice is needed!Please contact Karlene Fine, Gatekeeper of the North Dakota Industrial Commission at 701-328-3722 or ndicinfo@nd.gov or kfine@nd.gov to request speaking time (which will scare the pants off them); but, if you are unable to travel. give them hell with letters-to-the-editor, by contacting journalists, with emails & phone calls, and by rallying associates to contact the Commissioners.Recruit Congresspeople, Senators, and Governors, if you can.The North Dakota Industrial Commission Governor Jack Dalrymple (Chairman of the NDIC)http://governor.nd.gov/contact-us (701) 328-2200Chief of Staff Ron Rauschenberger rrausche@nd.gov (701) 328-2200Ag Commissoner Doug Goehring ndda@nd.gov (701) 328-22311-800-242-7535Assistant to the Commissioner Jody Reinke jodyreinke@nd.gov (701) 328-4754Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem wstenehjem@nd.gov ndag@nd.gov (701) 328-2210As you can see; they are going to make the actual hearing very difficult.

54	NEW: Orange County is the latest NY government to take action over the growing movement of crude oil through the Hudson Valley by train, barge and ship.  “The passage of these resolutions sends a powerful message to both state and federal government that Hudson Valley citizens and their elected representatives are not willing to idly stand by and wait for a train derailment or barge accident that results in a toxic and potentially explosive crude oil spill in our communities,” said Kate Hudson, Riverkeeper's Watershed Program Director. “The action taken by the Orange County Legislature highlights the urgency of the situation and puts pressure on our government agencies to use their emergency authority to immediately implement measures to put the brakes on this dangerous practice.

64	This will not stand up in court: The Thruway Authority approved a $255.7 million loan for Tappan Zee bridge construction that makes a mockery of the Clean Water Act loan program.  "The stakes are too high to let this illegal raid on Clean Water restoration funding go through without a fight.  Riverkeeper will be right in the middle that fight, which is where our members rightly expect us to be, whenever government action runs this far afoul of the environmental laws designed to protect the Hudson River.” Read more of Riverkeeper President Paul Gallay’s statement: http://www.riverkeeper.org/?p=31920		Riverkeeper	20:14:11	08-06	2014	19	25	2	1	1
65	Now it’s the NY Thruway Authority’s turn to vote on the illegal raid on clean water funds for construction of the new Tappan Zee Bridge. Will anyone listen to the EPA or others who raised questions since the Environmental Facilities Corp. approved this scheme? “The same day the EFC voted to approve the loan, there were two water main breaks in Syracuse that shut down streets and left workers and residents in the city without water due to aging infrastructure,” Riverkeeper's Phillip Musegaas said. “This is just one example of a significant need for clean water projects that will go unfunded due to the State rushing this loan through. Using clean water infrastructure funds to pay for a transportation infrastructure project is improper and inconsistent with federal and state law, and sets a dangerous precedent.” Read what Riverkeeper and other groups are telling the Thruway board in advance of the vote on Gov.
