13	Lack of rain got your lawn looking brown? If left alone lawns turn brown in the hot summer months. Many people think of these lawns as dead or unkempt, but it is a completely normal phase in a lawn's life cycle that you can take advantage of to help reduce your water use during dry months.Dormancy is simply a state of reduced water usage where the plant focuses resources on the roots. Lawns can stay dormant with no water for up to a month. In most places, that is long enough for a summer rain to fall and keep the lawn alive without you having to get out the sprinkler. In places without rain for longer periods of time, it might be best to move on to more drought-friendly landscaping. Embrace the Brown. Be Proud. Share so your parents, kids, and friends know Brown is Normal when it comes to summertime lawns. Posted from our archives.		YardMap	10:00:01	08-26	2014	88	25	2	1	1

Located in the Midwest, this 3-acre site has a lot going on to provide habitat for wildlife, including the reduction of several nonnative invasive plant populations, starting the restoration of native prairie, planting many beneficial native plants, and providing nest boxes for birds throughout the habitat. Visit their YardMap and you’ll find many other important habitat features, such as a compost pile, rain barrels, and brush and rock piles, all of which help to conserve water and soil while benefiting birds. And the owners have only lived there a couple of years! This is one impressive site that many YardMappers admire.	YardMap added 5 photos.	YardMap	12:25:15	07-09	2014	26	25	2	1	1

50	Birds + 4th of July probably conjures images of majestic bald eagles, but we hope you'll pause, fireworks in hand this 4th, and think about all the song birds in your neighborhood. Dogs are famous for getting freaked out on the Fourth, but that effect doesn't stop with our canine friends - birds and other wildlife feel the impacts of our celebrations as well. Remember back when all of those red-winged black birds died in arkansas? Yeah, that was fireworks. Lucky for us, that kind of effect is really rare, especially in summer (those birds were all grouped together in a relatively small space because it was winter, and that is what they do). Still, consider skipping the fireworks at home, and just head out to your community show.There is even a research team in amsterdam using radar to study the effects of fireworks on birds: http://bit.ly/Tsfqe0		YardMap	10:00:01	07-03	2014	92	25	2	1	1
51	Did you know that American Goldfinches nest later than most song birds? Nesting usually occurs in June or July, or around the time that thistle and milkweed (and other plants) produce seeds that goldfinches use to build nests and feed to their nestlings (another great reason to plant milkweed, in addition to helping monarchs!). Check out the YardMap article on flowering plants for more info: http://bit.ly/1oIYXBb.Milkweed and thistle are sometimes considered weeds, but weeds are only weeds if you decide you don't want them. Many so-called 'weedy" plants are bird favorites, and will delight you as you watch goldfinches perform their daring feats of acrobatics to get at the delicious seeds. Dedicate a patch of your yard to let "weeds" grow and you'll be amazed at all the wildlife that uses it. Photo: American Goldfinch on field thistle.		YardMap	10:00:00	07-02	2014	1420	25	2	1	1

73	More pollinator habitat tips for your yard for National Pollinator Week:Bees have been in the news lately as research continues to show their populations are in trouble. In Europe certain pesticides shown to negatively impact bees were even outlawed for the next couple of years to help populations recover. You can help-out by letting small corners of your yard go fallow. The resulting wildflowers are important forage for bees, native and the like. It is an easy, and important step many people can take, that might just have a big impact on these wild pollinators.		YardMap	10:00:00	06-19	2014	88	25	2	1	1

76	Learn more about gardening for pollinators by downloading your planting guide at YardMap's Your Local Resources page: http://content.yardmap.org/explore/local-resources/As we continue to celebrate Pollinator Week, we thought you might enjoy this research recap from our archives:Most of you know about honey bees, but did you know there are also over 4000 species of native bees in N. America? Scientist were curious if bee diversity is important to crop yield so they controlled not only the number of bees visiting a field, but also the number of KINDS of bees visiting. They found that fields that were visited by more kinds of bees had greater seed production than those visited by just one. In this case, diversity matters. You can help preserve bee diversity by keeping your yard diverse. More kinds of plants, more heights of vegetation, and more detritus on the ground. All of which help create both bee and bird habitat.		YardMap	10:00:00	06-17	2014	47	25	2	1	1

82	Several species of birds, many of which are experiencing significant population declines, lay their nests in grasslands, hay fields, and meadows from April 1 through mid-July. This also happens to be a time period many landowners see as prime time to harvest hay.See the problem? Eggs and newly hatched chicks have little chance of surviving a mower, but every week you delay the harvest increases these grassland birds' chances of successfully fledging and getting out of the way.Give grassland fledgings a chance! Be Slow to Mow. Don't mow from April 1 - mid-July.

84	Newly fledged songbirds are most vulnerable during the first three weeks after leaving their nest. A recent study (http://bit.ly/1liwFw4) found that 'teenage' songbirds seek refuge in cover habitat as they learn the skills to survive in the big world. Although the study examined young songbirds in natural areas, cover habitat is a critically important component of habitat for backyard birds as well. Many teenage birds are out and about this time of year, and we can all provide a little parental assistance by creating or enhancing cover habitat on our properties. Thickets of native shrubs, evergreen clusters, and brush piles are all great forms of cover habitat for your backyard habitat. And help keep all birds safe by keeping cats indoors!Learn more about shrubby habitat and brush piles at YardMap: http://bit.ly/1igIjDh		YardMap	10:00:00	06-10	2014	1286	25	2	1	1

87	The winner of YardMap's Make My Backyard Birdier photo contest is "Chickadees in the Brush Pile" by Mary Maertz of Wisconsin. How many chickadees can you spot in the photo?   We love this wintry photo for many reasons, the first being that it showcases brush piles, which are an important and easy-to-make habitat component for birds. Brush piles provide essential cover for birds, and when placed next to a feeder, as Mary has done, you give birds a safe place to eat and to take cover quickly, if need be.  It also provides a respite from inclement weather, such as snow, wind, and rain.Mary writes, "We created this brush pile from fallen limbs several years ago. It receives a lot of use from the feeder birds, including the Black-capped Chickadees in the photo. I think they roost in the pile as they seem to come directly from the stack to the feeders in the morning. We have had a Northern Shrike unsuccessfully chase the chickadees in and out of the pile several times." As the winner of the photo contest, YardMap staff ecologists will work with Mary to develop habitat landscaping recommendations for her property. Thank you for the great photo, Mary!Find out how you can create brush piles: http://bit.ly/1rMNrZj		YardMap	10:00:01	06-05	2014	2	25	2	1	1

97	Happy World Turtle Day! This is a busy time of year for many turtles who are traveling to lay eggs. Be on the lookout for turtles crossing roads and, if you can do so safely, lend them a helping hand by carrying them to the side of the road they are traveling towards. If your backyard habitat includes a pond that supports turtles, make sure you provide perches. Leave wild turtles where you find them, and never release a pet turtle into the wild. Volunteering for local river cleanups and refraining from littering are all ways we can help provide healthy habitat for turtles.		YardMap	15:17:17	05-23	2014	149	25	2	1	1
98	Turning your yard into wildlife habitat is gratifying for you (and wildlife), but sometimes puzzling and upsetting to your neighbors who think the "habitat" looks like you're just being lazy. The article below, from the Press of Atlantic City, NJ, covers a contentious situation between two neighbors, and how they came to a resolution. A bipartisan bill is now being proposed in NJ that would establish a state wildlife habitat certification program to help promote a more ecologically-friendly approach to landscaping and protect private landowners who garden for wildlife from citations and fines. How great is that?The article raises an important point for those of us who prefer a more "natural" look to our properties - sometimes our neighbors don't share the same aesthetic as we do. To keep the peace, there are a few things we can do to our wildlife habitat, like mow a small border around the property boundary (as discussed in the article) or put up a sign that shows your property is "certified wildlife habitat" through the National Wildlife Federation or a Monarch Waystation through Monarch Watch. You might just start an informative conversation about gardening for wildlife and get your neighbors interested and involved in the effort! 		YardMap	10:00:01	05-21	2014	47	25	2	1	1
