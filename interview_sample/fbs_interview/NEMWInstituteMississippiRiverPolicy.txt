Here is this Friday’s Mississippi River Basin Water Resource Weekly News link, including a look at the litigious- and politically-robust news of the week gone by, and a look ahead to what’s on the agenda for next week (and the rest of September) in the U.S. Congress (which returns to “action” next Monday).   Among the many news items crossing our virtual desk, the week saw EPA’s Inspector General finding fault with the agency’s voluntary, state-centric approach to reducing the size of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone, a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in Kansas being told he cannot withdraw from the race, environmental groups seeking to overturn a new EPA cooling water intake rule, other environmental groups suing Kentucky over its new coal-mining, water quality protection rule, and House Republicans prioritizing efforts to stop the Obama administration from finalizing its proposed “Waters of the U.S.” rule.http://ow.ly/B8626 		Northeast-Midwest Institute Mississippi River Basin News	13:33:27	09-05	2014	0	1	0	1	1
