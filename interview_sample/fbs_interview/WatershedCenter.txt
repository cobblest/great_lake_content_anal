39	Last week's rains overwhelmed sewer systems across metro Detroit, forcing millions of gallons of untreated and partially treated sewage into rivers and lakes. Macomb County alone logged more than 1 billion gallons in overflows from storm-retention basins and sewers countywide.Did you know that in Traverse City we have a separate sewer and stormwater system preventing that from ever happening?

52	The DNR recently diagnosed type C botulism in wild waterfowl along the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. Type C botulism is not an immediate risk to humans, although pets, including dogs, could acquire the toxin if they were to eat a dead bird. In the Great Lakes region, both types C and E botulism are reported annually, although this is the first case of botulism in Michigan this year. (Type E avian botulism has been responsible for loon and other waterfowl deaths, including piping plovers, in years past.)Any dead or dying birds that are found along the south shore of Grand Traverse Bay should be reported to the local Traverse City DNR office at 231-922-5280, ext. 6832. Please provide information on the location, type and number of birds. Botulism is a condition brought on by ingesting a naturally occurring toxin produced by bacteria found in the bottom sediments of water bodies. Because the water levels in the Great Lakes are higher this year than the past several years, water is currently on mudflats that had been previously exposed, and because the water depth is shallow, the anaerobic conditions necessary for the bacteria to grow are established. In the case of type C botulism, dabbling ducks or other shore birds feeding in the sediment can be susceptible to the die-off.		Watershed Center of Grand Traverse Bay	00:00:01	08-13	2014	1	1	0	0	0

68	The best offense is a good defense for invasive Phragmites. If there is not a good place for it to grow (areas without vegetation in shallow water that get sunshine) it is harder for them to take hold. And when they do, they don't take off and grow as rapidly, giving us a chance to catch them and treat them early on! Natural shorelines are key!

69	Native plants provide shelter and food for wildlife. They attract a variety of birds, butterflies, and other wildlife by providing diverse habitats and food sources. Closely mowed lawns are of little use to most wildlife.		Watershed Center of Grand Traverse Bay	20:45:00	07-31	2014	1	4	0	1	1

79	Cheers to our volunteers Jim and Sue Frye, who helped us survey for Phragmites on Spider Lake. Only one stand was found this year! Although Spider Lake is one of the largest lakes in East Bay Township and many of the lakes around it have a lot of Phragmites, we can attribute the low amount  to a very active lake association catching it early, 100% participation in the treatment program (when we find a stand it is treated that very year), and the majority of the lake having natural shorelines (trees up to the water's edge, native grasses, flowers and bushes along the water's edge, etc.).

88	Boats can unintentionally spread invasive species from one body of water to another, but most of these situations are avoidable by following a few, simple steps:* Clean boats, trailers and equipment before you launch and again after. * Drain water from bilges and livewells at the ramp before leaving. * Dry trailers, boats, equipment and storage areas thoroughly before using them in a different body of water. * Dispose of unused bait in the trash. * Don’t transfer live fish to water bodies, other than where they were originally caught. * Disinfect livewells and bilges with a bleach solution comprised of one-half cup of bleach to 5 gallons of water 		Watershed Center of Grand Traverse Bay	19:30:00	07-18	2014	0	2	0	1	1

96	Cigarette butts were the #1 litter item found at the beach clean-up. Some volunteers found so many they stopped counting. Take a guess at how many were found - the person with the closest guess will receive one of our new super-cool re-positional cling window stickers.

For those with younger kids it was a great way to connect them to their community and show them the value of community service. Thank you for teaching your children well!
