97	We got some great news this morning: A conference committee (House and Senate members) has approved a funding increase for programs to keep children safe from lead poisoning! While it's not officially a done deal, the committee's action all but ensures the Department of Community Health will get an additional $500,000 for lead abatement, bringing the total to $1.75 million. A HUGE thank you to the House and Senate members whose support means more homes will be made lead-safe to protect Michigan kids! MEC is proud to serve as a leader of the coalition that achieved this big success.		Michigan Environmental Council	14:13:25	06-10	2014	1	24	2	0	0

100	"Communities around Michigan are being targeted for oil and gas exploration as new technologies make it easier to find deposits of oil and natural gas. But when local residents organize to oppose mining projects, they often find there is an uphill battle to stop exploration and eventual drilling under a 3-year-old state law."
