With that legislation in limbo during election season, other bills around the country facing considerable industry pushback and the Illinois bill shown to have a significant loophole, we are committed to renewing the effort when the New York legislature returns to session in January.

35	Time is Running Out on This Season's Research!Dr. Mason Needs You to Contribute Now to Replace Equipment Essential to the Effort to Ban MicroplasticsEarlier we alerted you to the fact that microplastics researcher Dr. Sherri Mason has had an equipment loss that cripples her ability to conduct much needed research into the extent and impact of microplastics in the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. Save The River and other organizations are using her research to secure a ban of these polluting particles. See that post here.Many of you have responded already and we are about 50% of the way to the $3,500 it will cost to replace the lost manta trawl.You can contribute on our site here: http://ow.ly/Aczj5 Or our Indiegogo site here: http://igg.me/at/microplastics-trawlUnderstanding the extent and impact of microplastic pollution and enacting effective bans requires scientific research, and diligent, focused advocacy based on that research. Every contribution gets us closer to replacing Dr. Mason’s manta trawl, gets her closer to being back on the water before the end of our very short boating season and gets us closer to banning microplastics from our Lakes and River.The makers of the products that use these tiny, toxin accumulating particles want you to do nothing. But we know, as a Save The River follower, you understand the need and will make a contribution today.Thank you for your help in keeping this important research afloat and keeping the equally import effort to ban microplastics alive.
