2	This week, the Friends of the Central Sands had a significant court victory in their fight to protect water in central Wisconsin. In a challenge to the DNR's approval of a high-capacity well for the Richfield Dairy CAFO, the judge said the DNR “took an unreasonably limited view of its authority,” and that the public trust doctrine, statutes, and decades of court precedent required DNR to consider cumulative impacts. “It is scientifically unsupported," the decision said, "and impossible as a practical matter, to manage water resources if cumulative impacts are not considered.” This speaks to the very heart of what the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources exists FOR: to protect our drinking water. Citizens shouldn't have to go to court and pay big money to get the DNR to recognize its authority and use science - not politics - to make decisions on what happens to our water resources.www.friendsofcs.org		Midwest Environmental Advocates	15:46:59	09-05	2014	12	25	2	0	0

9	Is the Dead Zone Growing? A DCEC Presentation Featuring Gordon Stevenson - September 10, 7 p.m. at the Baileys Harbor Town Hall Door County Environmental Council program features Gordon Stevenson, former chief of runoff management with the Wisconsin DNR who retired after 26 years with the department. His professional expertise includes watershed-based water resource protection and control of diffuse water pollution sources. Stevenson has been instrumental in development of policies and administrative codes for Wisconsin involving both agricultural and urban non-point source water pollution. In particular, Gordon has been an architect of Wisconsin's environmental programs that apply to Wisconsin's extensive livestock industry.Admission for the presentation is free.

41	The largest pork producers in Iowa and North Carolina are seeing high numbers of livestock deaths from porcine epidemic diarrhea. Despite biosecurity funding and clean up efforts, much is unknown about how the disease is spreading and if a vaccine could be developed to stop it. The epidemic is shedding light on problems with the disposal of dead livestock and nearby groundwater, the cost of prevention,and even "ag gag" laws and the murky legality of aerial photography of livestock operations. We wonder if Wisconsin's growing number of hog CAFOs and lax regulations on aerial manure spraying could bring these environmental concerns here?

42	A recent report by the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) shows Wisconsin's Great Lake beaches are near the bottom of the list of clean swimming spots. But beyond recreation, pollutants like E.coli and the phosphorus that feeds algae growth threaten our health, the health of animals and the health of our interconnected water systems. And with Wisconsin's tourism industry bringing in $17.5 billion - $2.75 billion from fishing alone - our economic health is threatened by closed beaches as well. We need stronger leadership from the Department of Natural Resources to stop catering to special interests who want to slow the implementation of our state's innovative numeric criteria for phosphorus or other environmental law enforcement. The health of our state depends on clean water. Visit the NRDC's interactive website to see how your favorite beach scores. 		Midwest Environmental Advocates	14:26:12	07-07	2014	1	2	2	1	1

82	The Mississippi River must be designated as a Critical Conservation Area to qualify for needed federal conservation program funding.

83	Taylors Falls residents are speaking up about the increase in frac sand truck traffic through their town. But look beyond the "jobs vs. environment" theme of this story; tourism businesses need environmental protection. In Wisconsin, it's "jobs + environment."

A bonanza for a few lucky landowners, the new mines also promise jobs and economic stimulus for the small towns and rural areas nearby, but at what cost to the shared air and water of all the area residents?

93	Are we ready to deal with transporting Bakken crude oil through our state? Here is today's must-read from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel explaining what this week's federal order on rail safety has to do with cities like Milwaukee and La Crosse. 		Midwest Environmental Advocates	15:51:57	05-09	2014	1	1	2	1	1
94	An emergency order was issued yesterday by the federal Transportation Department directing railroads that operate trains carrying hazardous, flammable Bakken crude oil to disclose tank cars' routes and volumes of crude. Safety response plans in Wisconsin and across the Midwest can't wait. Emergency responses to derailments and explosions like the one that happened last week in Lynchburg, VA depend on transparency and accountability from an industry that ships an inherently dangerous product from North Dakota through our states.

95	North Dakota continues to have the highest worker death rate in the country with 17.7 fatalities per 100,000 employees in 2012, a dramatic increase from the 7/100,000 worker deaths recorded in 2007 before the state's oil and economic boom took off.

96	Politifact says the assertion that the iron mining deregulation law signed by Governor Walker would "fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste" is "mostly true." "Mostly" because of the idea of mitigation and whether a mining company can recreate natural wetlands elsewhere. 		Midwest Environmental Advocates	15:50:10	05-08	2014	0	0	2	1	1
97	Citizens in La Crosse aren't the only ones concerned about rail safety with the hazardous, flammable Bakken crude oil coming through their city. People in Ohio are also demanding safety plans and are asking why train transport information is not public.		Midwest Environmental Advocates	14:46:26	05-08	2014	0	2	2	1	1
