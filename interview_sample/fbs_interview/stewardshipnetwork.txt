20	Native plant landscaping for Detroit.Detroit’s five-year-old Dequindre Cut Greenway is landscaped with mostly native plants. A privately owned, weedy slope along the greenway needed work, so Detroit Garden Center stepped in. The scrappy DGC got permission from the owners to remove the weeds and plant some native grasses, sedge and sumac. The plants are still getting established, and you can help keep the area clear of weeds, while keeping an eye out for freighters on the river. Volunteer days are 2nd and 4th Fridays, 10 am – 12 noon.

48	Here are some fun facts learned at this morning's Stewards Circle about Pollinators:-If a female monarch carries a certain disease, she'll pass it on to her offspring. Using her feet to "taste" different plants, she'll lay her eggs on plants that have higher levels of toxins. When her eggs hatch and the larvae feed on the plant, the toxins will make the larvae grow more slowly but will also help combat the disease.-Many bees native to North America are solitary, without large nests or honey stores to defend. As such, they're very unlikely to sting you.-Without sonication, or "buzz pollination" performed by some of our native bees, tomatoes would be much harder to come by. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_pollination Thanks for hosting and facilitating this morning, George Hammond, Mark Charles, John Swales, and Tina Roselle!

59	"6th grade students learned about this invasive plant species [garlic mustard] in their life science unit in class – its origin, how it arrived in Michigan, how it upsets the balance of the ecosystem, and steps to stop the spread of the species. Experts, Sarah Pregitzer and Randy Butters, taught the class about invasive species in our area. Community member and environmentalist, Tanya Cabala, spoke to students about the environmental needs in the area. Students conducted a community inventory to identify areas where an invasive pull would be beneficial. Students pulled garlic mustard as part of Day of Service activities. Students also wrote an article for the White Lake Beacon to educate the community about invasive garlic mustard and invited the community to join the students when they pulled the invasives."Story and photos from Jennifer Szedga, Nellie B.
