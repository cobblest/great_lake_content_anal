69	The Syracuse Post Standard is as disappointed as we are in the members of the Public Authorities Control Board -- like Speaker Silver and Senator John DeFrancisco -- for approving Governor Andrew Cuomo's clean water raid even as the federal government raises concerns and New Yorkers are kept in the dark by the Cuomo Administration's secrecy: http://bit.ly/1zMyNmd		Environmental Advocates of New York	14:21:50	07-17	2014	0	13	2	1	1

71	READ and SHARE our statement from Peter Iwanowicz re: the Public Authorities Control Board voting to approve Governor Andrew Cuomo's dangerous clean water raid. http://bit.ly/1jQyWk6“Talk about putting lipstick on a pig! A raid is a raid, and public money should not be bandied about behind closed doors without proper public scrutiny and oversight. Governor Cuomo knows the federal government can and will very likely claw back any portion of this raid that does not meet the strict standards of their intended purposes. No executive, in New York or elsewhere in the country, should be empowered to unilaterally repurpose funds dedicated to our communities for their own pet projects.Governor Cuomo, Speaker Silver and Senator DeFrancisco failed New York. Using clean water funds to build a bridge is not creative leadership, it is behaving like a kid in a candy store. And we are no closer to knowing the Governor’s math for this loan or this bridge than we were a month ago.We believe the Administration’s secretive actions are in direct violation of state law. In addition to the potential loss of federal funds, Environmental Advocates and 11 other organizations are requesting the Public Authorities Budget Office to investigate the actions of the Environmental Facilities Corporations to ensure state law was followed at every turn.”		Environmental Advocates of New York	19:50:43	07-16	2014	0	12	0	0	0

73	BREAKING: The New York Post has just issued a scathing editorial calling on the Public Authority Control Board - which votes tomorrow - to reject Governor Andrew Cuomo's clean water raid! "Fact is, a total lack of transparency has been par for the course when it comes to this new Tappan Zee Bridge. Sen. DeFrancisco would do New Yorkers a real service by striking a blow for full disclosure — and voting to kill this dubious loan."

77	GOVERNOR CUOMO MUST END THE SECRECY!Governor Andrew Cuomo has failed to publicly release how he plans to pay for a new Tappan Zee Bridge, as well as the details surrounding his $511 MILLION clean water raid to help pay for its construction. Today, we joined our partners at Riverkeeper, Tri-State Transportation Campaign, NYPIRG and New York League of Conservation Voters calling for the release all of this critical information, which has been sought by public officials, advocates, editorial boards and the federal government.Peter Iwanowicz, executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York said, “The secrecy has gone on long enough, Governor Cuomo should immediately tell the public how he plans to pay for this bridge, and prove that his administration followed state law by producing the formal application and all relevant financial data concerning his clean water raid. No oversight entity – including the federal government or Public Authorities Control Board – can properly assess the impacts this raid will have on taxpayers, communities, our health or environment if Governor Cuomo insists on keeping basic information from the public.”READ MORE: http://bit.ly/1rbnIsr		Environmental Advocates of New York	16:44:56	07-14	2014	1	20	2	1	1

Of all the paths the governor could have chosen, raiding much-needed clean water funds, ignoring the out-year consequences of his action, and endangering federal dollars is the wrong direction.

93	One year ago today 47 residents of Lac Megantic, Quebec, were tragically killed when a crude oil train derailed, devastating that community. The oil industry secretly laid the groundwork to move these same trains carrying the same oil through New York.
