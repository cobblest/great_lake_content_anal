2	We Are Sea Grant Week, Part Two: Communications Director Moira Harrington was impressed by the flamingo-riffic tone of  a successful water-quality awareness campaign by Shafer Consulting in Sarasota, Fla., and the observation by invited speaker David Shiffman that social media can help debunk pseudo science. Meanwhile, GIS outreach specialist David Hart spent half-day sessions with research coordinators, extension agents and educators--the three pillars of Sea Grant: As he put it, "Researchers shared lessons learned from state and regional research competitions and electronic grants management. Extension agents shared a variety of emerging outreach opportunities. Educators focused on more effective reporting of program impacts. I'm looking forward to upcoming sessions on "Linking Research with Extension" and "Translating Research into Practice." These connections between the legs of the Sea Grant stool are very important."

81	He doesn't officially work for us any longer, but that doesn't mean that we don't partner with Tim Campbell, our former aquatic invasive species outreach specialist, on projects and outreach. Like sharing Tim's new Tumblr blog, which gets its name from a funny hashtag Tim used once on Twitter. He meant to convey #GoByBike in honor of his cycling jones. Titus Seilheimer, our fisheries outreach specialist, noticed that the lack of capital letters in the hashtag also read #gobybike--as in the invasive round goby. Follow it for the AIS info, and enjoy the bike stuff while you're there. 		University of Wisconsin Sea Grant/Water Resources Institutes	14:44:52	08-06	2014	0	4	0	1	1

83	You know we're primarily concerned with preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species, but we frequently partner and interface with  groups who focus on invasive plants. Like members of the Upper Sugar River Watershed Association, who are controlling the spread of purple loosestrife with its European native predator, a voracious beetle. Our videographer, John Karl, captured their efforts.		University of Wisconsin Sea Grant/Water Resources Institutes	19:58:10	08-05	2014	1	2	0	1	1
84	Today's Great Lakes trivia question seems like a total gimme, so we're going to add some caveats to make it more challenging.
