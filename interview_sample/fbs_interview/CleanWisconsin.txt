5	Please contact your local and federal elected officials and request them to call for an investigation and congressional hearing on fluoride in our drinking water.  Fluoride is being used as a drug to prevent and treat tooth decay.  This does not give people a choice.  There is mounting evidence showing it lowers IQ, increases asthma, bone fractures, arthritis, kidney disease, thyroid disfunction, and calcifies the pineal gland.   We need everyone to do this because there are so many issues that the squeaky wheel get's the grease.  http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/		Brenda Staudenmaier	16:28:08	09-09	2014	0	0	0	1	1

In a project sponsored by Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District - MMSD, we've partnered with Milwaukee's Northwest Side Community Development Corporation and Marek Landscaping to promote and implement low-cost and no-cost ways to treat storm water where it falls.
