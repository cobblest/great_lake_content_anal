12	Hey folks! We're helping our friends at South Lansing Community Development Association with the Hawk Island Kids Tri this afternoon and we really could use some more folks to pitch in and help keep the little ones safe. Mostly, we need a few folks to show up today around 3:30pm at Hawk Island and help for a couple of hours. You won't miss kick off as we'll be done in plenty of time! Just so you know what you'll be helping with ... The Goldfish (ages 0 - 6) will swim 25m, bike 150m and run 100m. We need a couple more people in the lake so that every kid is within a few feet of us at all times. We also need a few more folks to help the kiddos get on their trikes/bikes/Big Wheels and to tie shoes. The Dolphins (ages 10 and under) will swim 100M, bike 3 miles and run 1 mile. We need several more people to station out on the run and bike course. The Sharks (ages 11 - 14) will swim 200m, bike 4.5 miles and run 2 miles. We need one person on the bike course in case we have an emergency and one more person to monitor the run. And... all of these awesome volunteers will come to the finish line (as your assignment ends) and cheer on the littlest triathletes.

Avoid the area until further notice! We also suggest that for 24 hours after the rain, you use extreme caution on local waterways including the Red Cedar River and the Grand River due to debris, fast moving water in the flood plain and floodway as well unstable ground along the banks of local streams, tributaries and creeks.
