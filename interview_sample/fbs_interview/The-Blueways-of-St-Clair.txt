54	Please go to the link below and vote for Chris to win a grant!Port Austin Kayak offers kayak, bike and stand-up paddleboard rentals.I applied for a $250,000 grant to improve the Kayak Shop and Marina.  Please help me get the grant by voting at:  https://www.missionmainstreetgrants.com/business/detail/132018Two years ago I purchased a foreclosed, run down marina in Port Austin to run my kayak rental.  I have big dreams to rehabilitate the property.  I have slowly been fixing it up but financially it has been very difficult to take big steps.  This grant would solve that problem.  If I win the grant I plan to use the money to:1.	 Fix up the property using environmentally sustainable practices to create a place where the community will want to gather.  This would include a new façade and landscaping, a community garden, an area for music and poetry performances and an area for children to engage in physical activities, art and other creative enterprises.  I want to tear out all the cement and blacktop and add butterfly and hummingbird gardens, patios and decks, hammocks, swings and seating areas where the community can come together. 2.	 Improve the events that we already bring to town such as Detroit Up North and Tour di Lago.  I want to bring more events to Port Austin such as outdoor adventure camps for kids, triathlons, marathons and an Oktoberfest focusing on local wines and microbrews.  I want to sponsor an artist in residence yearly.   3.	Expand my business by adding retail outdoor clothing and gear and a restaurant/bar specializing in local food, wine and microbrews.4.	Promote the Thumb as a premier quiet sport recreational mecca.Please forward this to your friends and ask them to vote.
