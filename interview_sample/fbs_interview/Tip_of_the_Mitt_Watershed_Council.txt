87	The Michigan Department of Natural Resources developed a video to assist anglers and the general public in identifying juvenile Asian carp. Because bait is often transported across state lines, including from areas with breeding populations of Asian carp, it would be easy for juvenile Asian carp to make their way into the bait supply without anyone realizing it. This video showcases five characteristics viewers can use to distinguish between juvenile Asian carp (bighead and silver) and common baitfish. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tekJq3L0gPA		Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council	19:10:28	11-26	2013	1	3	0	1	1

The purpose of this survey is to improve understanding of boater movement between water bodies to better prevent transfer of nonindigenous (i.e. invasive) species. The survey will close October 15, 2013. http://www.surveyexpression.com/s/14801/2013BoaterSurvey		Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council	09:14:09	10-08	2013	0	0	0	1	1
