1	Hello there to all of you at Orange County Coastkeeper. I am Rick HannumI work at REM, Inc. Revel Environmental Manufacturing, Inc. We build StormWater Filter Devices for Curb and Grated Inlets. We also provide under contract a Service to clean out the debris that the filters catch and larger debris that makes it's way into our storm drains. I have been in the Water Treatment Industry since 1989... I am NEW here at REM, Inc. and I have the desire to make a difference for the better on the environment. So with that being said, I am asking all of the EYES and EARS within OCCK to refer me to violators that need and want help. For those violators that do not want help and will not happily take my info and contact me. Please Email me their contact info. I will gladly get their attention when they realize fixing their problems is a whole lot better then begging the inspectors for forgiveness. The companies and properties that can show they have a plan for their BMP's will most definitely benefit. So will our Ocean!

2	Good news for water quality today.  The State Water Board upheld the recent action by the Los Angeles Water Board to reduce copper pollution from boats in Marina Del Rey.  This will directly affect the copper regulations being developed for Newport Bay, and eventually Huntington Harbour and Dana Point Harbor.		Orange County Coastkeeper	22:11:02	09-09	2014	0	7	0	0	0

See the new report on the untapped potential of California's Water Supply by the Pacific Institute.

9	We could not be more grateful to have worked with such amazing students this summer! This album provides a glimpse of what great work our Summer Coastkeepers experienced. From upcycling toilet paper rolls to restoration at Bolsa Chica Wetlands, cleaning up Huntington Beach, and creating a nature mural, these students made an impact in their community! Upon the completion of the WHALES Summer Program, students pledged to make a difference. Take a look at our bright future! A hundred thanks goes out to the Peter's Elementary EcoClub, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Garden Grove and Huntington Beach.

We need to maximize our conservation efforts, and reap the multiple benefits conservation gives us ("free" water, less pollution, less energy use) before we even consider more expensive and less efficient ideas like ocean desalination.http://www.sacbee.com/2014/07/13/6548166/another-view-busting-water-conservation.html		Orange County Coastkeeper	00:10:04	07-15	2014	0	2	2	1	1

40	Copper pollution in Newport Bay is a problem that we still need to address.  Coastkeeper ran a four year project to encourage boaters to switch to non copper boat bottom paints.  Unfortunately few took advantage of the program.  The next step for Newport are regulations on copper like the ones just implemented in Marine Del Rey.  Doing this the hard way is going to be much more costly for LA County than voluntary changeovers.for the $4million they are wasing on un necessary studies we could repaint every boat in newport Bay with nontoxic paint. http://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2014/07/08/county-to-spend-4-million-on-pollution-study-in.html		Orange County Coastkeeper	22:35:33	07-09	2014	0	4	0	1	1

This includes effective state fishing regulations, creating Marine Protected Areas and eliminating the use of our ocean for cooling powerplants.  We also have to recognize that we are part of the larger earth ecosystem and work to put that back n balance.  That challenge lies before us and our children, failure to act is not an option. http://www.newsweek.com/2014/07/11/disaster-weve-wrought-worlds-oceans-may-be-irrevocable-256962.html		Orange County Coastkeeper	19:41:08	07-02	2014	0	2	0	1	1

50	Good Idea!  For the money they would waste on the Poseidon HB desalination plant our water districts could convert 400,000 homes to California friendly landscaping and save and estimated 61 acre feet of water a day.

68	Poseidon Update: Unfortunately last night the Orange County Water District Board voted 8-1 to move forward in their "investigation" of buying the full capacity of the Poseidon Huntington Beach Desalination Plant. This in spite of overwhelming public opposition to the project. This was confirmed by the 292 comments OCWD received opposing the project and only 3 in support. Ten people spoke at the meeting in opposition with only one speaking in support. While this is not a decision to buy Poseidon's water, i is a bad sign that they would even consider such a bad project.		Orange County Coastkeeper	17:14:37	06-05	2014	0	3	0	0	0

OC Coastkeeper has invited children from inland schools in grades 3-5 to experience the beauty of our ocean first hand and learn how they can protect it from pollution. Over 1,200 elementary school students will remove litter at Huntington State Beach that would otherwise pollute the ocean. The students will then move into a formation to create an aerial art design in the shape of a 200ft albatross on the sand! Check out this sketch!

90	Clamming used to be a popular activity at southern California beaches, now you rarely see it.  It was interesting to watch this guy clamming in the Santa Ana River just above the PCH bridge. He said they are deep but there are clams to be had.		Orange County Coastkeeper	19:00:32	05-01	2014	0	3	0	1	1

92	The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly beach news for Orange County beaches.  the good News is that we will have great beach weather all week.  The bad news is that all Orange County beaches are still under a three day cautionary posting from our Saturday "rain". The ugly news is that there was a sewage spill at Aliso Creek that has closed the beach there until further notice. http://www.ocregister.com/video/v/1886174758/laguna-beach-sewage		Orange County Coastkeeper	18:42:06	04-28	2014	0	2	0	1	1
93	We had a great group at our desalination presentation at Saddleback College.  70 more people now know the facts about desalination and are questioning why anyone would even consider the outdated Poseidon HB desalination project.		Orange County Coastkeeper	16:56:28	04-25	2014	0	7	0	1	1
94	Something to think about in the ongoing jobs vs. the environment point of view held by some of our Orange County leaders.  How about skipping the dumb desalination plant idea and restore some of our degraded wetlands in Seal, Huntington, or Newport Beach.  Good jobs and a healthy environment, what a great idea! http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/04/10/3422451/coastal-restoration-creates-more-jobs/		Orange County Coastkeeper	22:42:04	04-24	2014	0	3	0	1	1

96	Happy #EarthDay! Orange County Coastkeeper had a very successful Spring Celebration event at the Coastkeeper Garden! Over 250 children, parents and friends came out to enjoy the outdoors and see first-hand how beautiful a drought tolerant garden can be!  Check out photos from the event! http://tinyurl.com/lke7pxb ! Let's all do our part to conserve and protect our water supply!    1) Don't litter.  An estimated 80% of the trash found at the beach comes from inland sources.  2) Dispose of household hazardous waste properly.  Things like batteries, used oil, paints, solvents and other hazardous materials shouldn't go down the drain or in your trash can.  Check the recycling guide on Earth911.com.3) Use native and drought tolerant plants, which require less water and chemical fertilizers.4) Make a donation TODAY to support Coastkeeper Garden events, our watershed education program – WHALES and all the work OC Coastkeeper does to protect water resources! http://tinyurl.com/khts5la		Orange County Coastkeeper	19:09:59	04-22	2014	0	9	0	1	1
