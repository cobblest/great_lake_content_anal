98	What a fantastic workshop and tour we had on Saturday with Phil Hofmeyer of SUNY Morrisville on the topic of microhydro!  We counted 66 people from 5 counties crowded into the Lansing Community Center for the workshop and more than 40 who joined us to look at four nearby potential sites for hydro projects.  Phil was a wonderful speaker - so much expertise combined with top notch communication skills.  He wrote to say how much he loved our audience - saying it was the most informed group of people he has talked to on this topic.		Sustainable Tompkins	03:00:09	05-06	2014	0	4	2	1	1
