1	Last week we discussed the 15 ton "Fatberg" that was found in London's sewer system, largely due to cooking grease. GROSS! 
Now, on a much more appetizing note (and for all you bacon-lovers out there), here are 10 delicious ways to store and re-use bacon grease instead of throwing it out. Remember to never dump it down the drain.	19:48:57	08-26	2013	0	0	0	1	1
2	Ever wonder what happens when you flush things down the toilet or drain that you shouldn't? 
Folks in London found out the hard way when a 15 ton "fatberg" -- a mass of wet wipes and congealed cooking oil the size of a BUS -- was found to be blocking up sewer pipes and causing plumbing difficulties for residents. Fortunately, further crisis was averted after 3 weeks of emergency work. Phew!
Take a video journey through the sewer system of London and learn why refraining from flushing these items actually matters.	20:50:08	08-22	2013	3	9	0	1	1

Want the simple "Economics in Plain English" explanation as to why? This week, in their new video series, The Atlantic explains 7 reasons why bottled water is so marked up-- which includes that for every liter of bottled water produced, the production process uses TWICE as much.	17:52:36	08-15	2013	33	17	2	1	1

16	As temperatures rise in the summer, outdoor water use does too. In the U.S., as much as 50% is actually wasted due to inefficient watering methods and at a time when drought is threatening much of the country, it's important to try to use water wisely.

19	A recent  EPA survey estimates that $384 billion is needed for improvements to the nation’s drinking water infrastructure by 2030 so that safe drinking water can continue to be provided to Americans.
The Johnson Foundation at Wingspread has opened up a forum for experts from municipal government, business, academia, and the non-profit sector to discuss the topic "How to spend the next $100 billion". Check out what is being said and consider how water-efficiency can help with the issues.
You can also read the press release of the survey findings here:

20	Another great example of the water/energy nexus! Not only is selecting the right hot water heater important (learn more in this blog post from Energy Star) but pairing it with an efficiently designed hot water distribution system (which you would find in a WaterSense labeled new home www.epa.gov/watersense/new_homes ) means saving water, energy, money on utility bills and you won't waste time waiting for hot water to come to your tap or showerhead. Talk about coming out on top!	19:36:41	06-27	2013	6	13	2	1	1
21	Yesterday, June 25, 2013, President Obama announced his administration’s new plan of attack on climate change. The plan largely centers on cutting the nation’s carbon pollution and insists this challenge can be met in ways that simultaneously advance our economy, our environment, and our public health. American innovation and cleaner forms of energy will be needed, but one of the easiest ways to take action on climate change right NOW is to be more energy efficient in your home. Small changes amount to big savings (both for the planet and for your bills!).   
Americans may not realize that saving water means saving energy, and vice versa. Using less water overall means less energy is needed to heat, treat and pump water. By using a WaterSense labeled showerhead or only running the dishwasher when it’s full, you’re also cutting down on the energy needed to heat the water and run the appliance. If you look for WaterSense labeled products next time you’re improving your home, you’ll know that the product meets EPA criteria to not only perform well, but also be water AND energy efficient. 
Here are some fun facts from our latest Accomplishment Report to see how WaterSense labeled products really do make a difference (and not just for water!).

78	Lowe's Home Improvement's partnership with WaterSense never stops improving. Their support for the WaterSense program proved equally vital to the effective promotion of WaterSense labeled products and water-efficient practices in 2011. Through the success of a broad range of marketing activities and strategic partnerships, Lowe's earned the 2012 WaterSense Retailer Partner of the Year award—its third in the past four years—while helping customers save about four BILLION gallons of water in 2011.
Combine that with Lowe's Efficient Home campaign, their support for the "Wasting Water is Weird" campaign with Rip The Drip and their contributions to the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association (AMWUA)'s Fix a Leak Week celebrations and it's apparent why Lowe's was a clear choice for 2012 Retailer/Distributor Partner of the Year.	16:41:40	02-28	2013	1	14	0	0	1

81	Collaboration among utilities and other entities can take water-efficiency to new heights. A team effort led by 2012 Promotional Partner of the Year Colorado Springs Utilities, along with local builder Wayne Intermill, EnergyLogic, Inc., and 2008 Partner of the Year Ferguson Enterprises, resulted in the first WaterSense labeled home in Colorado and the six-state U.S. EPA Region 8. During the three-week 2011 Parade of Homes, 5,000 visitors explored the EPA WaterSense labeled home, which was also the first home to receive LEED for Homes US Green Building Council certification, Energy Star qualification, and the WaterSense label.
The utility also saved more than 20 million gallons of water in 2011, or one-third of the Utilities' annual water savings goal, by helping hundreds of commercial kitchens save water by offering them free, water-efficient pre-rinse spray valve nozzles for cleaning dishes. A Colorado Springs Utilities team visited nearly all of the participating kitchens to demonstrate how the nozzles function, gauge the businesses' satisfaction with the products, and offer advice on additional water-efficient upgrades. Great work from our 2012 Promotional Partner of the Year, Colorado Springs Utilities!	17:34:13	02-20	2013	1	17	2	1	1

85	3x WaterSense Manufacturer Partner of the Year and 2x Excellence Award winner KOHLER knows that wasting water is just plain weird. That's why they teamed up with other partners and EPA WaterSense to launch a PSA campaign called "Wasting Water Is Weird." Rip The Drip dropped into people's homes when they wasted water to remind them just how weird it is to use more water than you need. Kohler also supported Habitat for Humanity by donating WaterSense labeled products in 550 Habitat homes in California and Texas. Finally, Kohler introduced 40 new WaterSense labeled toilet models in 2011, including the most water-efficient dual-flush toilet in Kohler's history.

163	A Facebook follower asked how to choose a water efficient hand-held sprinkler. We did a little research. Turns out that using a hand-held sprinkler is the most efficient way to water.
