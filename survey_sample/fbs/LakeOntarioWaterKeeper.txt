Follow them to get inspired: Because Girls Can.We're cheering them on with quotes from Tanis Rideout's "Arguments with the Lake", a beautiful new book of poetry that describes the challenges of swimming across Lake Ontario - and of moving through life in general. To the swimmer, the struggle is all-consuming. To Lake Ontario, she's barely a slip in its vast waters. The question for you this weekend is this: where will YOU connect with water?
