A congressional committee is poised to approve bill undermining environmental reviews of Army Corps of Engineers water resources projects.We urge you to tell your representative that the harmful environmental “streamlining” provisions must be stripped from the bill to ensure continued protection of the St. Lawrence River and our nation's other inland waterways.More information here: http://savetheriver.us/?p=4700		Save The River	20:00:11	09-18	2013	0	5	0	1	1

11	Work Boat Sinks in Cape Vincent, Spills Oil. Earlier today a small work boat sank in about eight feet of water in the vicinity of the Wolfe Island Ferry dock and an as yet undetermined amount of fuel has leaked to the River. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation spill responders and the State Police are at the scene and efforts are underway to contain fuel that is continuing to escape to the River.While it is too soon to have a clear picture of exactly what the extent of the spill will be, we are fortunate that it is a calm day so that the area affected is relatively contained. With DEC on the scene we are encouraged that proper steps will be taken. We will continue to monitor the situation. Any spill is a wakeup call for everyone that the River is a fragile, vulnerable and challenging environment that requires all users to maintain the highest standards of maintenance to prevent it happening and preparation to respond once it does. This highlights the critical need for emergency preparedness planning and training, and the pre-placement of spill containment assets along the length of the River.

40	New Seaway chief Betty Sutton seeks economic, green balance.That's the headline of a NCPR story today and from her record it rings true. It's just we all know that at times the challenge is in finding that balance among all the seeming competing interests."Sutton says she believes in finding a balance - between the 227,000 jobs and 33 billion dollars in revenue that Seaway shipping generates in the Great Lakes on both sides of the border, and protecting the fish, wildlife, plants, and water quality of the largest surface fresh water system in the world."We at Save The River are encouraged by Administrator Sutton's initial statements. Undoubtedly she has an big job ahead of her, and many tasks will be competing for her attention but we are ready to engage in a constructive effort to improve and enhance environmental protections for the St. Lawrence River. An effort we believe, and we believe Administrator Sutton's record shows she believes, can go hand-in-hand with job creation and retention.We look forward to continuing the dialogue initiated under Acting Administrator Craig Middlebrook.Read and listen to the full story here: http://ow.ly/o7PH7		Save The River	13:48:04	08-21	2013	0	5	2	1	1

54	Save The River Joins Other Keepers, Expresses Concerns about Enbridge Tar Sands Pipeline.From the letter: "We are writing on behalf of Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, Ottawa Riverkeeper - Sentinelle Outaouais, Lake Erie Waterkeeper, and the Upper St. Lawrence Riverkeeper regarding the application by Enbridge Pipelines Inc. to:● reverse a 639 km section of their Line 9 pipeline between North Westover, Ontario and Montréal, Québec;● increase the capacity of the entire Line 9 pipeline from 240,000 barrels per day (bpd) to approximately 300,000 bpd; and● begin using the pipeline to transport heavy crude.Between Sarnia and Montreal, Line 9 passes through the Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Ottawa River, and St. Lawrence River watersheds. It traverses many sensitive habitat areas, including designated Areas of Concern, river beds, and wetlands. Combined, these watersheds provide drinking water for approximately 26 million people. Line 9’s path crosses many small creeks and streams, as well as larger rivers, all of which provide fish habitat and feed into major drinking water sources for Ontario, Quebec, and the United States.We make this submission to the National Energy Board because we are concerned that this project has the potential to negatively impact the swimmability, drinkability, and fishability of water in our watersheds. We submit that negative impacts are possible, and indeed, likely; that such incidents must be prevented; and that, should such impacts occur, mechanisms must be in place to minimize harm to the environment and to hold Enbridge accountable.Full text of the letter here: http://ow.ly/nGvzk		Save The River	18:40:57	08-06	2013	0	4	0	0	1

58	Plastic, yet another (sometimes microscopic) threat to health of our River. Studied by UB students & many others.From the UB Reporter article, "Microplastics, defined as smaller than 5 millimeters, are not only toxic, but can be mistaken for food by birds or fish. Eating the small bits of debris can lead the animals to believe they are full, when in reality they are malnourished or dehydrated. It could even cause them to suffocate.""And because most animals can’t digest plastic, garbage eaten by fish or birds remains in their bodies long after the animal dies. People could also catch and consume animals filled with the plastics."Full article here: http://ow.ly/nzuQQ		Save The River	13:52:28	08-02	2013	0	2	0	1	1

81	Save The River is excited to report that beach water samples taken on July 22nd  passed and the beaches are safe for swimming!Save The River’s Beach Watch Program is in the process of monitoring popular summer swimming locations on the river from July 1st through August 26th.AND REMEMBER between July 26 and 28, we are encouraging you to capture your perspective on “swimmable water” in a photo of your favorite beach and swimming spot on the River then post your photos and stories to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram with the hashtag #SwimmableWater and @savetheriver. They will be shared and used to create a unique photo essay about water around the world.For the 2013 sampling season, Save The River volunteers are collecting water quality samples at six swimming areas along the river: Wilson Beach in Cape Vincent, Potter’s Beach on Grindstone Island, Frink Dock in Clayton, Round Island in Clayton, Lake of the Isles on Wellesley Island, and Scenic View Park in Alexandria Bay. Save The River’s unique program provides a snapshot of water quality at popular swimming areas during the peak recreational swimming season. Sampling dates for this year are: July 22, July 29, August 5, August 12, August 19, and August 26.As in previous years, Save The River is testing for E. coli in all of our swimming spots and will compare water quality results with state and federal regulations. The results will be made available to the public each week with a pass/ fail system that is available at the Save The River office, website, and by following Save The River on Facebook and Twitter. Results will also be posted on www.swimguide.org and in the TI Sun.For more information please call the Save The River offices at (315)-686-2010 or contact us by email at intern2@savetheriver.org.

133	THIS IS THE POINT . . . “The fish need marsh meadow habitat in order to spawn,” Ms. Fleming, of Ducks Unlimited said.“Lake Ontario has seen a drastic loss of marsh-meadow habitat, which is a required habitat of spawning northern pike,” Ms. Fleming said. “The loss of marsh meadow and increase in non-native cattail has reduced available spawning areas.”Plan 2014 is the natural, non-mechanical way to begin the process of restoring an estimated 64,000 acres of marsh meadow habitat lost due to unnaturally constrained water levels.This excellent article in the Watertown Daily Times (http://ow.ly/mGYdm) highlights the great work being done by Ducks Unlimited, SUNY-ESF and others on mechanical restoration.

We believe these hearings, one of which will be held at Bonnie Castle, July 17th at 6:00pm, will provide a clear path to the adoption of a plan.From our initial review – it looks like Plan 2014 is the plan that our communities have been waiting for. Citizens who love Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River finally have some action from decision makers toward a modern, protective water levels plan. The International Joint Commission (IJC) has characterized Plan 2014 as Plan Bv7 with deviations, so we will examine the deviation policy very closely. While Bv7 wasn't a perfect plan it was a good plan in its recognition of the need to take environmental impacts into account (and, we have said all along, a healthy environment supports a healthy economy in the North Country), so, if the deviations in Plan 2014 do not take away the environmental benefits, Save The River, should be able and willing to support Plan 2014.Visit www.savetheriver.org for updates.

186	Send a telegram . . . yes, a telegram . . . to Governor Cuomo and the IJC urging support for #Bv7Now!Plan Bv7 was proposed over a year ago by the International Joint Commission after more than ten years and $20 million of study and input from over 180 stakeholder groups. But public hearings have not been scheduled and we are facing another season of outdated, damaging water levels management.1958D, the current water levels plan for the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario, was developed in the fifties on slide rules. Like many policies from the fifties, it completely ignores the environment and causes significant harm to the people and businesses that rely on a healthy Lake and River.But unlike most outdated, harmful policies from the fifties it is still in place. The status quo is no longer an option, but our efforts using modern means of communication have not been successful. So this month hundreds of Save The River members will send telegrams to Governor Cuomo and the IJC telling them that a 50 year old water policy is not good enough for the Lake and River and urging them to support Plan Bv7.Will you join them?We made it easy and inexpensive . . . .For less than $6.00 you can send a real, old-fashioned telegram supporting Plan Bv7.Click Here (http://savetheriver.us/?p=3728) to send your own telegram (you can pick from samples we provide or write your own) and to get a special promo code for supporters of Plan Bv7 We need our government to finish the job and implement Plan #Bv7Now!Changing international water policy can be expensive please consider making a contribution to help us continue the fight. http://ow.ly/l66uj		Save The River	15:34:35	05-16	2013	0	9	2	1	1

Healthier Lake and River wetlands will support stronger populations of native fish and wildlife, improving the area’s hunting and fishing, and strengthening the recreational economies that rely upon them.Plan Bv7 will also extend the average boating season by a few weeks, providing a boost to our River region tourism-based economy. As of mid-May 2013, River levels would be an inch and a half higher under Plan Bv7.More than 50 organizations and over 9,100 people, including hunting and fishing clubs, Chambers of Commerce, local governments, environmental groups and recreational boaters have expressed their support for Plan Bv7.We need our governments to finish the job and implement Plan #BV7Now.

191	NY Celebrates Water Week, Should Push #Bv7Now.According to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, "Water Week is a time to think about how fortunate we are for the state's abundant water resources and how we can all help protect, restore and conserve it."We at Save The River could not agree more and we urge the Governor to take action now on Plan Bv7 - a modern water levels plan that will help protect, restore and conserve Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, both vital waterbodies to the state and local economy.This outdated water levels regulation plan for the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario which completely ignores the environmental damage it causes year after year is causing significant harm to the people and businesses that rely on a healthy River.And unlike most outdated, harmful policies from the Fifties it is still in place!So in the week when New York celebrates "Water Week" and the Governor holds a tourism summit, we - the thousands of New Yorkers and visitors to New York who live, play and work on the Lake and River - need our governments to finish the job and implement Plan #Bv7Now.Other things from the Fifties never worked. The difference? We moved on.Check out our water levels information page (http://ow.ly/kMWr1), "Like" us here.

194	Things change. So should our water levels plan. #Bv7Now. If it worked well in the Fifties does that mean it works now? Well actually, NO!We've learned a lot since the 1950's. And we've used all that "learning" to improve every aspect of our lives. So why are we still stuck with a water levels plan developed in the 50's on a slide rule (or maybe an "analog" computer)?Its time to replace Plan 1958D with a modern water levels plan.This outdated water levels regulation plan for the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario which completely ignores the environmental damage it causes year after year is causing significant harm to the people and businesses that rely on a healthy River.Unlike most policy from the Fifties, it is still in place!We need our governments to finish the job and implement Plan #Bv7Now.Check out our water levels information page (http://ow.ly/kje9F), "Like" us here and stay tuned to find out how you can help take action for a modern water levels plan now.
