13	NOAA held a teacher training workshop for 25 teachers at GLERL's LMFS (Lake Michigan Field Station) on August 6. This session was part of a one-week professional development opportunity for Muskegon area teachers, funded under a NOAA Environmental Literacy Grant to Earth Force (a non-profit educational organization located in Minneapolis, Minnesota). Earth Force is committed to using active learning strategies in the classroom by combining science education and service learning. In implementing the literacy grant, Earth Force staff are working with the West Michigan Great Lakes Stewardship Initiative and the Muskegon Area Intermediate School District. Tuesday’s workshop, which involved cruise time on the R/V Laurentian, featured an overview of NOAA programs as well as sessions focused on marine debris, food webs, and invasive species. During the Laurentian cruise, the teachers were given a lesson on how invasives have disrupted the Lake Michigan food web, using fresh samples as visual aids. The teachers also had an opportunity to learn about NOAA assets which they are being encouraged to use in their classrooms. As part of the grant, teachers are responsible for working with their students to encourage participation in projects that will help improve their Great Lakes environment. Notably, this event engaged three NOAA line offices (Ocean and Atmospheric Research (OAR), National Ocean Service (NOS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in working together in sharing their expertise with area teachers. It proved to be a great way to connect NOAA with the educational community in Muskegon.		14:45:44	08-16	2013	0	10	2	1	1

15	Harmful algae blooms (HABs)  are an issue in and beyond the Great Lakes, as far away as China!   In Lake Erie, as reported in the article below,  oceanographer Richard Stumpf, with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leads forecasting of HABs. Stumpf expects to see a significant bloom on Lake Erie this year:  "The bloom just started in the past week on the far western part of the lake," Stumpf reports. "There was scum on the surface of the lake.""Stumpf's goal with the algae forecast is not just to predict where the algae is, but where it is not, so that people in unaffected areas of the lake don't lose tourist revenue because the whole body of water has a bad reputation for algae."		16:28:27	08-13	2013	3	4	0	1	1

35	The Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory and the Cooperative Institute for Ecosystems Research are pleased to announce our next Great Lakes Seminar Series presentation:Monday, July 29 at  10:30 am, Lake Superior HallAn integrative investigation of sources, fate, and transport of bacteria in Milwaukee coastal beaches (see description below)Dr. Marcia SilvaDepartment of Civil Engineering & MechanicsUniversity of Wisconsin – MilwaukeeIf you would like to Join us for a Webinar on July 29Reserve your Webinar seat now at:https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/916210834Space is limited.Sources of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) were examined in ten Lake Michigan beaches. In depth studies were performed at one study site (Bradford Beach) to investigate possible sources of FIB, including groundwater-lake water interactions and runoff infiltrating through the sand. The impact of hydrological and geophysical factors that are associated with formation of standing water were also investigated, including the potential of FIB reservoirs in the sand matrix to serve as a sink and source of bacteria at the beach environment. In order to better understand bacterial association with particles at a large scale, the small scale interactions between bacteria and particles were examined by developing a new non-invasive optical technique and applying the technique to assess attachment of bacteria to sand particles in a sheared fluid simulating condition found in the surf zone. Finally, the knowledge obtained from the understanding of small scale interactions was used to interpret the results acquired from a statistical model applied to large scale features at Bradford Beach and Atwater Beach, Milwaukee, WI.		15:10:57	07-25	2013	1	2	0	0	1

49	NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) and partners issued a seasonal forecast for harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the western basin of Lake Erie. The forecast predicts a "significant" algal bloom, however, it is expected to be about 1/5 the size of the 2011 bloom. The algal forecast is based, in large part, on the amount of rain that falls on farm fields (fertilized with phosphorus) in Erie’s drainage basin which includes the Maumee and Sandusky rivers.Rick Stumpf, NOAA’s algae modeler and forecaster presented the forecast on Tuesday (July 2) at a press event held at Ohio State University’s Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island, near Put-in-Bay. In Ohio. At the event, Stumpf explains that “Significant means that people will notice a bloom"..."However, you can plan your activities around a bloom of this scale.” Stumpf recommended that those interested in getting updates about HABs in Lake Erie subscribe to NOAA's Harmful Algal Blooms in Lake Erie Bulletin (http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HABS/lake_erie_hab/lake_erie_hab.html)  which offers weekly updates of bloom locations and impacts. The bulletin is housed at the NOAA Center of Excellence for Great Lakes and Human Health (CEGLHH).Also discussed at the press event was the need to address the source of the HAB problem through the reduction of phosphorus loading based on a voluntary management plan.		18:04:05	07-03	2013	0	7	0	1	1

111	Deployment of a real-time weather buoy will help strengthen the forecasting capabilities of NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) stationed in Grand Rapids.  The buoy - equipped with state- of-the-art sensors and technology - will provide "up to the minute" observations for nearly 150 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline from Manistee to St. Joseph.  Among the variables being monitored by the buoy are average wind speed, direction, gust, air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wave height and period, and water temperature.  The buoy is currently located approximately 3 miles from shore in eighty feet of water.  NOAA GLERL’s Lake Michigan Field Station will assist in final placement of the buoy, halfway between Holland and Grand Haven later this month.  Bob Dukesherer, Senior Forecaster with the NWS in Grand Rapids comments: "Real-time data from a buoy in the nearshore zone is invaluable for checking the validity of our marine forecasts and providing lead time on hazardous weather events for both boaters and swimmers alike."  This project is built upon a partnership between NOAA, Great Lakes Observing Systems and LminoTech (www.limno.com) with funding for the buoy provided by the NOAA Coastal Storms Program, a nationwide effort to make coastal communities safer by reducing the impact of coastal storms.

129	As reported by Minnesota Public Radio on NOAA GLERL research on the fluctuations of Great Lakes water levels: "More recently, evaporation over lakes has steadily been increasing, largely due to increases in water surface temperature," Gronewold said. "That's a climate response, there's no other way to say it." How that will play out over the long term, he said, is hard to predict. That's because while a warmer climate could mean more evaporation, it could lead to a repeat of the heavy snowfalls seen over the Great Lakes this winter. It also could mean more rain falling over the lakes, the kind of deluge seen last summer, when a massive storm dumped 10 inches near Duluth and caused historic flooding.		15:20:42	04-24	2013	4	1	0	1	1

178	NOAA GLERL’s Lake Michigan Field Station Facility Improvement Project: Building for the future with design that reflects priority on both energy and work efficiency! (see photos in post below)The Lake Michigan Field Station (LMFS), Muskegon Michigan, is the primary field office for NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab (GLERL). The LMFS is home port for GLERL’s research vessels and is the center for the Green Ship Initiative. The facility, located on the shore of Lake Michigan, includes a historic former Life Saving Station built in 1904. With its distinctive building architecture and prime location adjacent to public parks, the Field Station has become an icon of the Muskegon community.A facility improvement project at the Field Station, recently completed in 2012, addresses infrastructure deficiencies and improved resources to support growth in the Green Ship Initiative and field science projects. The design and construction process followed many of the LEEDS objectives established for much larger buildings and new construction, which was a choice rather than a requirement. These engineered elements and construction practices met the objectives of sustainability, efficiency, and limited environmental impact. Reuse of 80% of the existing structure, new materials from regional sources and selection high efficiency components support sustainability goals. The construction process was controlled to minimize impact on the water front property and construction waste was carefully sorted on site for recycling. The application of renewable energy was matched to the scale of the building.The exterior of the building was designed to complement the architecture of the adjacent 1904 main building. A boat house that stood on the site 100 years ago offered design details that have renewed relevance today. Large windows provide natural light and ventilation to all work areas. The second floor loft offers valuable storage and layout space that also enhances natural ventilation. Even the multiuse, shared workspaces reflect the utilitarian feel of the original building and promote teamwork. The scale and versatility of the design reflects the priority on both energy and work efficiency. Equal focus was placed on reducing energy demand and utilizing available renewable energy.It is hoped that the LMFS will become a resource for Federal facility and fleet managers, partner institutions and industry to experience wind, solar and bio-fuel installations. The scale, open access to equipment and interaction with staff will provide a unique opportunity for others to explore these technologies with a focus on practical maintenance and operation. The building includes a conference center and technology workshops that will effectively support this outreach effort. This exercise in the integration of environmental and cultural stewardship, efficiency, technology and mission can be a case study for effective government investment.		15:54:35	03-26	2013	0	9	2	0	0

181	The Agenda with Steve Paikin, sponsored by Ontario's public educational media, is a flagship current affairs show offering in-depth analysis and intelligent debate in the rapidly changing world around us.Last week's program (March 21) on The Agenda featured "Trouble on the Great Lakes." The program focused on declining water levels in Lake Ontario, discussing climate change to suspicions that liquid "Blue Gold" is being siphoned off and sold. NOAA GLERL's Drew Gronewold was a panelist on the show, providing a scientific perspective on Great Lakes water level fluctuations, painting the big picture on this priority Great Lakes issue. For more information on GLERL's research on Great Lakes water levels, check out GLERL's webpage: http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/now/wlevels/levels.html developed by Gronewold and his team.		14:14:14	03-25	2013	1	1	0	1	1

185	As reported by Rebecca Williams of NPR's Michigan Radio, The Environment Report: "Some people have tossed out the idea that our warming climate could change the length of the shipping season. Over the years, there’s been less ice on the Great Lakes because the lake water has been warming. Researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have found that ice cover has declined more than 70 percent on the Great Lakes since 1973."

191	Posting on behalf of IJC: A Draft Adaptive Management Plan for Extreme Great Lakes Water Levels is online and available for public review until April 15. A series of webinars also are planned. For more, see http://ijc.org/boards/stlawrencerivertaskteam/comments/ (text from link pasted below)On May 29, 2012 the IJC issued a directive to establish the International Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Adaptive Management Task Team and directed it to develop a detailed Adaptive Management Plan to address future extreme water levels in the Great Lake-St. Lawrence River system.On March 15, 2013 the bi-national Adaptive Management Task Team released its proposed Adaptive Management Plan, Building Collaboration Across the Great Lakes – St. Lawrence River System: An Adaptive Management Plan for Addressing Extreme Water Levels. The proposed Adaptive Management provides a new approach to addressing water level issues, one that is based on working collaboratively with partners in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River system to gather and share critical information over time, assess the information with state-of-the art tools, develop adaptation strategies, measure our collective success in managing the impacts of extreme water levels and adapt accordingly. Its goal is provide a more efficient and cost effective way to support decision-making aimed  at reducing the impacts associated with future extreme water levels.The Adaptive Management Task Team is seeking input from the public on the draft Plan between March 15 and April 15, 2013. In particular, the Task Team would like feedback on the following:Do you support the general adaptive management approach for addressing future extreme water levels?How could the proposed Adaptive Management Plan be improved?What concerns do you have about the proposed Adaptive Management Plan?The Task Team is hosting a series of webinars to provide more information on key aspects of the proposed Adaptive Management Plan.
