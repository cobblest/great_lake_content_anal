103	4th and 5th graders show off salamanders and crayfish they found and tell us what finding these critters means about water quality in Muddy Branch. This was from our 2012 program. Video and photos coming soon from the 2013 Creek Freaks After-school program that started last week. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewR9CDCvXA0&edit=vd		20:25:57	04-12	2013	0	0	0	1	1
104	Make your own watershed model activity. This is a great way to demonstrate pollution and its prevention. Model on the right shows how much cleaner our streams can be when we pollute less, plant trees and native gardens, protect wetlands, etc. See the full instructions for this activity in the Izaak Walton League's Outdoor America magazine at http://www.iwla.org/index.php?ht=action/GetDocumentAction/i/2194 We should have more photos of this activity in action soon - our after-school group will be making these on Tuesday.		20:06:40	04-12	2013	0	3	2	1	1

108	Our Creek Freaks afterschool program at Jones Lane Elementary got off to a great start. We have 8 enthusiastic 4th and 5th graders. One young man told us all about his past adventures exploring the stream (Muddy Branch). Our two veterans from last year found frogs, crane fly larvae and egg masses exploring under rocks. We'll get some photos and video up soon. Looking forward to next Tuesday!		18:05:39	04-11	2013	0	0	0	0	0

Informative and entertaining, it includes pretty fun cartoon drawings of the bugs with funny commentary on their life histories.

111	The Izaak Walton League of America is seeking to host a Chesapeake Conservation Corps volunteer for the 2013-2014 service year. The Chesapeake Bay Trust program, open to people aged 18-25, is a competitive opportunity for Volunteer Applicants and Host Organizations that are selected and matched by the Trust.

112	EPA How's my waterway app allows you to find out if streams or lakes are clean or polluted. Use it on a computer and search by zip code or use it on your mobile device to get information on the closest creeks and streams.

124	Don't let rain water go to waste. Capture it for use later on your plants and save money on the water while protecting local streams. Even better, you can purchase rain barrels through this Muddy Branch Alliance fundraiser and also help build a native plant garden at Rachel Carson Elementary School in Gaithersburg, MD at the same time. Purchase your rain barrel and then attend this workshop on April 13 to learn how to install it.	Creek Freaks shared Muddy Branch Alliance's event.	18:12:11	04-03	2013	0	0	0	0	1

130	Free Webcast April 3 on the Findings of the National Rivers and Streams Assessment  http://ow.ly/jErZW. Before the webcast, be sure to check out my blog post about the assessment, which shows 55% of streams are in poor health, but also unknowingly highlights the lack of available data on our waterways and the need for volunteers.

132	I had a great time today training 15 volunteers in Virginia Save Our Streams in Reston today. And congratulations to the 6 who took the certification test. Everyone passed with flying colors. Unfortunately Glade Creek did't do so well. Unacceptable water quality.		23:48:31	03-30	2013	0	4	0	1	1

135	Off to train some stream monitors in Reston Virginia tomorrow. I'll send pictures from the field. I'll try to get one of me with my manicured nails. Rose nail polish will look so nice against a scud, don't you think?		00:05:10	03-30	2013	0	0	0	1	1

137	Want to know if that stream you're walking past is clean or polluted? EPA's How's My Waterway mobile app at http://watersgeo.epa.gov/mywaterway/ will tell you if the stream is polluted or acceptable. Of course, this information exists for only a small portion of our streams (less than 20% nationwide) and some of the information is 5 or more years old. You can change that by monitoring water quality yourself and reporting it. Find out how at www.creekfreaks.net.		03:19:01	03-29	2013	0	0	0	0	1
