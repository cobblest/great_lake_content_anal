It is part of a large natural system consisting of Mill Creek, its tributary and contiguous floodplain, wetlands, and forest vegetation that provides habitat for a variety of terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal species. We will walk and explore the benefits to the community through its removal and restoration of the impoundment area in a manner that would embrace the creek as an ecological, recreational, and economic asset.

105	I could not make the meeting in Ypsi Township last night but here are my thoughts: Lets increase  the viewing access to Ford Lake and Huron River in Ypsi area. It is our greatest natural resource and its obscured from view by trees or other things that are easily removed. Visitors never know they are next to a lake or River at various points. Lets embrace the Lake (along Grove and other places) and the River by allowing everyone to see its beauty. Such a simple fix. 		Carl Lumberg	18:15:49	05-31	2013	0	0	2	0	0

The park contains 127 acres of rolling-meadows and wildflower-filled woodlands. County Farm Park is part of a sequence of the Malletts Creek Stream Restoration Project, to improve water quality and habitat while maintaining safe, stable drainage throughout the Malletts Creek basin. Malletts Creek is the largest waterway in Ann Arbor. Stormwater runoff continues to be the primary cause of water pollution in the Huron River. Walk with us and learn about the watershed from Washtenaw County’s Environmental Manager Harry Sheehan and HRWC staff member Laura Rubin.*Meet at the park entrance off Platt Rd. behind the Meri Lou Murray Recreation Center.

129	Hi all,I am thinking of kayaking home from work (Island Lake  to Zeeb Road).  This will be an overnight trip if I can get it figured out.  I would plan to launch from Island Lake around 3PM, paddle for 5 hours or so, camp, then finish up the next day.  On the map, it is about 12.5 hours, nit sure what it will be in reality, but I expect faster. Problem is that there are no camping opportunities where I would really need to stop over for the night.  It looks like I would want to stop somewhere between Huron Meadows and Strawberry Lake.  I see there are some woods and a field or two in that stretch, but no approved camping opportunities.  Does anyone know anything I do not?  Or does anyone know a farmer or landowner in that stretch that would not care if I hung my camping hammock up between a couple of trees for a night?  Thanks!

The name Water Hill comes from streets in the neighborhood named Spring, Fountain, and Brooks, a legacy of streams running down the hill and along the eastern border (now all underground), a nearby water treatment plant, and the Huron River that winds through public nature preserves to the north and flows over Argo Dam and the Argo Cascades at the base of the neighborhood’s eastern bluffs.
