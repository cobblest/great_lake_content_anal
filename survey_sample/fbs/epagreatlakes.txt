1	On Monday, a stretch of #GreatLakes shoreline opened to the public.  Lake Metroparks officially opened "Lake Erie Bluffs"  adding 1.6 miles of shoreline for hiking, camping and outdoor recreation. By the end of this year, Lake Erie Bluffs will house some 600 acres total of coastal public open space. The project was funded in part by #GLRI.  "This kind of thing doesn't just happen with the wave of a magic wand," said Cameron Davis, senior advisor to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, "It only happens when communities work together, when states work together and when the country as a whole works together."

They then wash the sediment down into a net tube, rinse away all the mud and sand, and then wash what remains into sample containers at the end of the net tube. These are preserved for categorizing, measurement, and analysis back at the lab. They will track the size and abundance of a wide variety of species and develop a health score for each site based on the abundance of contaminant sensitive species. When sensitive species are abundant, the ecosystem is in good health.		Great Lakes Restoration | EPA & Inter-Agency Task Force	19:58:40	08-14	2013	0	9	0	1	1

The video, combined with information about the animals collected in the sediment grab will be used by the scientists to understand how the benthic community is changing over time and how invasive mussels are changing the bottom-dwelling community in the Lake Huron food web.

19	Most of the mercury entering and leaving the Great Lakes comes from the atmosphere as a gas. Even though mercury is a metal it evaporates. The USGS scientists are measuring mercury gas in the air above the #GreatLakes and in the water. They have brought aboard equipment to pull mercury gas from the water. (photo on left) Water flows from the lake via a special hole in the hull and is pumped up to the equipment. The mercury gas is drawn out of the water and sent to a very sensitive instrument that measures it. They are also sucking air from outside the ship to find the concentration of mercury gas in the atmosphere. (photo on right) With the measurements, they can figure out how much of the mercury gas is entering the lakes and contributing to the mercury in the foodweb.

There are many different exciting experiments and tests happening in the labs throughout the ship. One is the sediment oxidation-reduction potential measurement, or redox potential, which involves inserting an electrode into the sediment. The redox potential measures  the sediment’s reducing or oxidizing potential. It informs scientists if the sediment contains any oxygen and if chemical compounds like iron have been reduced or if they are in their oxidized forms.

51	More about the R/V Lake Guardian Dissolved Oxygen survey.  Areas of low oxygen in the water column have been recorded annually over the last several decades in Lake Erie's Central Basin.  Low oxygen levels stress plant and animal species that depend on oxygenated water for normal respiration.  The annual low oxygen zones, referred to as hypoxic or anoxic zones, are often linked to excess nutrient runoff into the lake.  The dissolved oxygen study is a focused investigation of oxygen content and key nutrient levels (i.e. phosphorus) in the Central Basin of Lake Erie to assess improved or declining conditions over time.

173	In September 2012, the Au Sable River Large Wood GLRI project was completed on the Huron National Forest. Co-funded by the Michigan DNR, the project used a helicopter to place a total of 126 trees in the Au Sable River below Alcona Dam. This project marked completion of a large-scale restoration effort that has placed more than 1,200 trees in a ten-mile stretch of river. The Au Sable River watershed drains approximately 2,000 square miles into Lake Huron and is one of Michigan's premier recreational assets. http://go.usa.gov/YBJQ		Great Lakes Restoration | EPA & Inter-Agency Task Force	15:59:02	10-10	2012	1	6	2	1	1
