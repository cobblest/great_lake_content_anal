189	Because of the low snowpack, this will be a great year to cross the Sierra. Your trip should start by reading the sensational new eBook, Sierra Crossing.  Find it at www.wildearthpress.comSIERRA CONDITIONS NOW by eBook author Tom Stienstra: Spring and early-summer conditions have arrived from Yosemite Valley up to 13,053-foot Mount Dana above Tioga Pass. Last week's temperature tantrum unleashed snowmelt; in turn, waterfalls are peaking and should stay flush well into June. The Four Mile Trail, which connects Yosemite Valley (4,000-feet elevation) to 7,214-foot Glacier Point, opened last week, with views of 2,425-foot Yosemite Falls available about a mile up. On the John Muir Trail, the "Ice Cut" portion above Vernal Fall has opened, the earliest in years, for access to Nevada Fall. In the high country, the snowpack is only 26 percent of normal for May, about 10 to 15 percent compared to last year, and the trail from Tioga Pass to Mount Dana is about 50 percent snow-free. Wilderness access should be decent by mid-June.		Wild Earth Press	16:05:54	05-17	2012	0	0	0	0	0
