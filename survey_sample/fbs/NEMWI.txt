48	Minnesota’s Water Quality Standards and the Triennial Review Process Water quality standards are one of the primary tools used to protect the quality of water in Minnesota’s lakes and streams.  Under the federal Clean Water Act, the MPCA is required to obtain public input on the need for amendments and additions to Minnesota’s water quality standards at least once every three years.   In recent years the three year requirement has been difficult to achieve, in part due to the complexity of technical reviews for standards development and the state rulemaking process.  To address this, the MPCA has re-worked the Triennial Standards Review (TSR) process so that it is independent of water quality standards rule-making and can occur at regular, three year intervals.  The MPCA hosted a webinar to share changes being made to the Triennial Standards Review process on September 4, 2013.  A recording of the webinar is available on the MPCA’s website, as are the webinar slides.  To access the webinar, webinar slides or further information about Minnesota’s water quality standards, use the following link:  http://www.pca.state.mn.us/qzqh1081		Northeast-Midwest Institute Mississippi River Basin News	12:01:11	09-18	2013	0	1	0	1	1
