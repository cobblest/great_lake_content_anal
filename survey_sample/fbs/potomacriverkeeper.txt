The campaign is spelled out in hundreds of pages of memos, invoices and other documents sealed as part of a 2004 lawsuit.

171	We have to ask if the Ag Certainty bill was such a good idea, why did the Maryland legislature rush it through without debate? The Maryland environmental community overwhelmingly agrees that this legislation is bad policy. This bill, which was rushed through both chambers, will provide a 10-year free pass to a single industry on future clean water laws. This bill sets back important efforts to restore the Bay and make our local waters cleaner and healthier.		Potomac Riverkeeper	19:20:22	05-07	2013	0	2	0	0	1

183	Scientists continue to unravel the mystery of the fish kills that occurred in the North and South Fork of the Shenandoah River in 2004 and 2005. Since those kills, the population of highly prized smallmouth bass has recovered and fishing has returned to legendary status. This recovery drives the quest for answers to what happened eight years ago this spring so we can take steps to avoid a recurrence. There have been important developments from the US Geological Survey scientists in the Fish Health Branch at the Leetown Science Center. The scientists have published a series of peer reviewed reports that help identifying missing puzzle pieces that link intersex in smallmouth bass with chemicals found in the river and provide clues to the overall decline in fish health.http://shenandoahriverkeeper.org/press-release-life-after-fish-kills		Potomac Riverkeeper	16:41:32	04-26	2013	0	4	0	0	1
