85	Our Comprehensive Water Quality Monitoring (CWQM) database has been updated. This highly-accurate water quality data for lakes and rivers in Northern Michigan, collected consistently for the last 20+ years, has been compiled into a single database that can be used to evaluate aquatic ecosystem health, examine trends within or among water bodies, and identify specific problems. This database is available to water resource professionals and other concerned individuals to further our common goal of protecting the water resources in Northern Michigan. If you have questions about the database, contact Kevin Cronk, kevin@watershedcouncil.org. http://www.watershedcouncil.org/protect/comprehensive-water-quality-monitoring-program/		Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council	10:34:00	07-03	2013	1	0	1	1

96	Tell Governor Snyder to Veto SB 163Michigan’s Wetland Protections At RiskOn June 12, 2013, the Michigan House passed SB 163 which would weaken wetlands regulations in Michigan and jeopardizes Michigan’s assumption of the Section 404 program.Now it's up to Governor Snyder to protect the Great Lakes by vetoing this bad bill.Wetlands are some of our most valuable resources – they provide homes for wildlife, maintain water quality, and protect us from floods. This is a bad bill because:·  It fails to comply with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and thus could result in the loss of the program assumption currently held by Michigan.· The bill will increase program costs by placing more burdens on the department and create delays in permitting. · The bill exempts certain activities, reduces mitigation requirements, and changes what wetlands are regulates, all of which reduces wetland protection in Michigan.· The bill reduces clarity and predictability by changing language currently used by the department to define which wetlands are regulated by the state.Tell Governor Snyder to veto SB 163 now! http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57827-267869--,00.html		Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council	17:05:34	06-14	2013	1	2	1	1
97	A large amount of vegetable oil spilled into Crooked River via a storm drain. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqsY4Jkvuhs		Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council	19:44:35	06-13	2013	0	2	1	1
98	Due to an auto/semi truck collision on M-68 in Alanson, a large amount of vegetable oil spilled into a storm sewer drain that lead to the Crooked River. Not only did this remind us that "Stormwater Matters" and as in this case goes untreated before entering a body of water, it also prompted questions about what to do when you observe something of this scale. Here's what our Policy Specialist recommends... To notify DEQ for spills or releases to the environment - there are two options:  PEAS (see below) or contact the District office directly and they can get appropriate staff on-site, if deemed appropriate.  Depending on the nature of the spill, where, what, etc., different staff may respond (Water Bureau, Remediation, Oil and Gas, etc.). Pollution Emergency Alerting System (PEAS) InformationContact: Bruce VanOtteren 517-373-8427In case of environmental emergency affecting AIR - LAND - WATERCall: 1-800-292-4706 The PEAS has been in operation since 1975. The 24-hour toll-free number for calls is 1-800-292-4706. The PEAS hotline should be used to report environmental pollution emergencies such as tanker accidents, pipeline breaks, and releases of reportable quantities of hazardous substances as required.  Please see the Spill/Release Reporting and Emergency Planning websites for additional spill/release reporting and prevention information. The phone number rings into an answering service which is staffed 24 hours a day. Between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on normal working days (Monday-Friday) the operators give callers the option of contacting the appropriate Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) district office serving the area where an incident has occurred, or the operators will take the information and dispatch the calls to the district offices for the caller.During non-business hours (after 5 P.M., holidays and weekends), calls are referred to a DEQ employee who is on-call for the PEAS. That individual completes a Report of Incident and determines whether immediate referral is necessary or if the information can be referred during normal business hours. Calls are directed to DEQ staff or other agencies depending on the nature of the situation. The nature of DEQ staff response is generally to provide technical advice to first responders on actions they can take to minimize environmental damage.
